"Global growth seen lower in 2019, UBS says, but it's not all bad","Global economic growth is expected to slow down in 2019, according to UBSTighter monetary policy, weaker earnings growth and political challenges are confronting major economiesUBS expects global economic growth to slow to 3.6 percent in 2019","Global economic growth is expected to slow down in 2019, according to UBS, as tighter monetary policy, weaker earnings growth and political challenges confront the world's major economies. After seeing a growth of 3.8 percent in 2018, UBS said in its outlook for the year ahead that it expected global economic growth to slow to 3.6 percent in 2019. ""Our outlook is that U.S. growth will be constrained by ebbing fiscal stimulus and higher interest rates,"" economists at UBS said in a note Wednesday. China, meanwhile, is facing the twin pressures of import U.S. tariffs and economic rebalancing. ""The decline in global growth will mean a weaker tailwind for global markets, which could begin to anticipate an end of the economic cycle as 2019 progresses,"" the investment bank said. In the meantime, solid domestic demand in the euro zone will not be sufficient to offset reduced export growth, the bank said. On the bright side, UBS said a recession looks unlikely given current rates of consumption, investment and employment growth ""and we think the typical causes of a downturn are unlikely to materialize in 2019."" ""Our base case is for inflation to stay contained, allowing central bankers to remain sensitive to growth. We don't foresee a major fiscal policy shift or a commodity price shock. Consumer balance sheets are in solid shape and improvements in banking sector capitalization since the financial crisis reduce the risk of a global credit crunch."" It also noted that there are growth opportunities and pockets of value. ""Economic and earnings growth are waning in aggregate. But this slowdown will not be felt uniformly by every country, sector, or company,"" economists said. ""We expect robust growth in firms exposed to secular trends like population growth, aging, and urbanization. Meanwhile, some assets have already begun to factor in a more challenging backdrop."" Among the biggest challenges facing the world's largest economies is a new era of tighter monetary policy following a decade of stimulus after the financial crisis of 2008. Central banks in the U.S., U.K., euro zone, Japan and elsewhere introduced a mixture of low interest rates and expansionary monetary stimulus programs, known as ""quantitative easing"" (QE) — essentially large-scale asset purchases — in a bid to boost spending in the economy. While these tools were useful in re-establishing stability in global financial systems, central banks are keen to ""normalize"" such policies. The U.S. has already stopped its QE program and hiked interest rates four times in 2018 while the European Central Bank confirmed in December that QE would end at the end of the month, with bond purchases falling from 15 billion euros ($17 billion) a month to zero. Amid ongoing Brexit uncertainty, meanwhile, the Bank of England has yet to say when its own QE program will end, although interest rates have been raised slightly. UBS noted that the coming year will represent the first time since the global financial crisis when central bank balance sheets are on track to end the year smaller than they were at the start of it. The Federal Reserve last raised its benchmark interest rate in December from 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent. UBS said it expected U.S. rates to be 100 basis points higher (at 3.5 percent) by the end of 2019, adding that low and falling unemployment rates also increase the risk of higher inflation, which could spark even faster rate rises. The prediction of lower global growth comes at an already gloomy time for global equity markets, with shares falling on fears of a potential worldwide economic slowdown and worries around the pace of central bank tightening. In 2018, U.S. stock indexes posted their worst year since 2008 while Europe's pan-European Stoxx 600 also suffered its worst year in a decade. UBS noted that tighter monetary policy will focus market attention particularly on debt serviceability. ""Potential hotspots include U.S. and Chinese corporate leverage and Italian government debt,"" it said. It sees profit growth in the U.S. market, which comprises more than half of the global equity market, falling off to roughly 4 percent in 2019 from an eight-year high of 21 percent in 2018. UBS said it anticipated 9 percent earnings growth in emerging markets and around 5 percent in the euro zone. Noting the limited long-term return potential, UBS said investors would have to ""temper their expectations"" in the coming years. The bank said the one-off boost from corporate tax cuts which were instigated by President Donald Trump in 2017 will not be repeated, and tit-for-tat tariffs on imports between China and the U.S. will begin to have a negative impact on the economy. On the trade war, UBS said tensions run deeper than just trade and that investors should prepare for relations between the two powers to continue affecting markets. Other political events that UBS thinks investors should take into account this year are elections in India, South Africa, Greece, Canada, and Argentina. Europe will also vote for the EU parliament in May, U.S. presidential campaigning will begin, while instability could provoke a return to the polls for citizens in Italy, Germany, and the U.K. ""Polarized electorates make political outcomes even more uncertain than normal,"" UBS warned.",2019-01-02 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/02/ubs-2019-outlook-global-growth-to-slow-in-2019.html?&qsearchterm=,12,864
"Keep your money in stocks regardless of risk appetite, UBS says","UBS, the world's largest wealth manager, said investors should keep their money in the stock market this year regardless of their risk appetite.Investors would have missed out on a 10 percent rally if they had sold their holdings on Christmas Eve and re-entered the market this month, said Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management.A recession is not likely to happen this year, so corporate earnings can still grow, although slower than before, Haefele said.","UBS, the world's largest wealth manager, said investors should keep their money in the stock market this year regardless of their risk appetite. Markets have been volatile in recent months as investors re-position for slower global growth and heightened uncertainties. That's set to continue, leading some investors to consider whether it's time to get out of equities and hold cash before a recession hits — but UBS said there's still money to be made in the stock market. ""You have to stay invested, whatever your risk tolerance can bear,"" Mark Haefele, global chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, said on Monday. ""The period of 18 months to 6 months before a recession is often when you get most of your returns because that's when economies do strongly,"" he told clients at the UBS Wealth Insights forum in Singapore. He noted that investors would have missed out on a 10-percent rally if they had sold their holdings on Christmas Eve — when U.S. stocks experienced a massive sell-off — and re-entered the market this month. In addition, a recession is not likely to happen this year, so corporate earnings have room to grow, although at a slower pace than before, he said. Haefele said UBS is ""overweight"" on global equities, adding that investors should diversify their share holdings outside of their home market to avoid an over-exposure to particular risks. ""At this time, it's better to invest globally. People tend to concentrate on their own region and that gives them two kinds of over-exposure: One is you're overweight a certain region, and also some regions tend to be overweight certain sectors,"" he said. In Asia, UBS likes China, Singapore, South Korea and Indonesia, said Tan Min Lan, head of the Asia Pacific investment office at UBS Global Wealth management. The bank doesn't like markets in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Malaysia and the Philippines, she added. On specific stocks, Tan said UBS likes ""high-yielding Asian equities"" such as major Chinese banks, and real estate investment trusts in Singapore and Hong Kong with large market capitalization. ""If you take into account corporate fundamentals, still positive growth rates and China policy easing that is ongoing, we do think that this year, equity markets will probably return between 12 to 15 percent in total returns,"" Tan told CNBC's ""Capital Connection."" But trade tensions between China and the U.S. remain the elephant in the room, and that ""will define Asia's fortunes not just for 2019, but also in the years ahead,"" she noted. ""Our base case is that there will be sufficient progress in the trade negotiation to delay further tariffs escalation, but the substantive issues will still remain. So, the most likely scenario for U.S.-China is in the years ahead, there will still be many rounds of fights or talks over a broad range of issues,"" she said.",2019-01-14 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/14/ubs-wealth-insights-overweight-global-equities-likes-china-shares.html?&qsearchterm=,8,474
Chevron upgraded at UBS: a safe haven stock amid volatile oil prices,"UBS upgrades Chevron to buy and says shares could rise as much as 21 percent.The oil and gas major is positioned to thrive even during a period of volatile crude prices, the investment banks says.UBS highlights Chevron's ""enviable"" asset portfolio and its ability to fund both capital expenditures and dividend payments with Brent crude at $50 a barrel.","UBS is upgrading Chevron to buy, saying the oil and gas giant is positioned to weather a sudden drop in crude prices. The investment bank thinks shares of Chevron could rise as much as 21 percent based on its 12-month price target of $135. The stock popped $1.65, or 1.5 percent, to $113.61 on Friday. Oil prices plunged more than 40 percent from peak to trough in the final quarter of 2018. UBS says the volatility shows the value of a ""conservative"" and ""sustaining business and financial model"" embodied by Chevron. Despite a 12 percent drop in Chevron's stock price during the oil price pullback, ""we believe that that the intrinsic value of the shares is materially unaffected; that the financial and operating model of Chevron is explicitly constructed to cope with this type of volatility; and that absent a material and structural change in the oil market (which we don't believe is the case) the share price weakness offers an interesting entry point,"" UBS analyst Jon Rigby wrote in a research note on Friday. UBS highlights Chevron's ability to fund both capital expenditures and dividend payments with Brent crude futures at $50 a barrel — about $12 below the current price. The bank says capital expenditures remain ""generous"" and Chevron's debt relative to equity is low compared to peers, giving the company the ability to take advantage of opportunities as they arise. Chevron's asset portfolio is also ""enviable,"" in the bank's view. The start-up of liquefied natural gas projects will help the company generate cash, while it's ""industry-leading"" position in the Permian basin, the largest U.S. shale oil field, reduces risks. That gives Chevron time to consider investments in capital-intensive fuel refining facilities and offshore oil and gas projects.",2019-01-18 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/18/chevron-upgraded-at-ubs-a-safe-haven-stock-amid-volatile-oil-prices.html?&qsearchterm=,4,290
"Global market liquidity could 'freeze like the water in Davos,' UBS' Ermotti says",Swiss bank chief Sergio Ermotti has warned that financial liquidity in global markets should not be assumed. Speaking on the same Davos panel J.P. Morgan's asset and wealth management chief said a lack of liquidity is “what we all worry about.”,"Assumptions about global liquidity are wrong and market activity could freeze up quickly, according to the chief executive of Swiss bank UBS. Last month, the Dow and S&P 500 equity indices recorded their worst December performance since 1931 - the era of the Great depression. It was also the biggest of any monthly loss since February 2009. Stocks got dumped amid concerns of an economic slowdown and fears the Federal Reserve might be tightening conditions to a point where liquidity in markets could dry up. For investors, liquidity is the ability to sell an asset reasonably quickly and at a price close to where it last traded. Speaking Thursday, on a CNBC-moderated panel at the World Economic Forum in Davos, UBS chief executive officer, Sergio Ermotti, said the December sell off was due to a convergence of macro and political fears as well as a growing understanding that the financial system may not let investors move capital as easily as before. ""The implied assumption that we hear about liquidity being there, being able to step in and function the levelling out tensions, is the wrong assumption,"" he said before adding ""liquidity can freeze very easily, like the water in Davos."" Ermotti said that among its US investor base at the end of the fourth quarter in 2018, there was an historic high of 24 percent cash asset allocation as investors pulled back from the market. ""This is not liquidity that is there for reinvestment. This is there because people fear that things will go wrong,"" he warned. The Swiss banker said many of the world's bigger investors were now managing money for others and, unlike banks, they not might stand by willing and able to trade an asset just to ensure markets run smoothly. The panel, moderated by CNBC's Geoff Cutmore, also included Mary Callahan Erdoes, J.P. Morgan's asset & wealth management chief executive. The asset allocator, who also sits on the Federal Reserve Bank of New York's Investor Advisory Committee, said a lack of liquidity is ""what we all worry about."" Callahan Erdoes told the Davos audience that since 2008, an additional $11 trillion worth of assets had been pumped into the financial system which had thrown up strange pricing levels. As an example, the U.S. banker noted the situation in 2017 when 85 percent of the Italian high yield market traded below the yield of U.S. treasuries. In typical conditions, the yield on U.S. treasuries should be lower than Italian high yield as it is considered a much safer investment. The J.P. Morgan executive said these market anomalies ought to ""get cured"" when the capital was eventually redeployed but warned that people could find danger amid a lack of market makers and a gap in liquidity. The Volcker rule — a post-crisis regulation to curb banks making big bets with their own money — has been criticized by banks for reducing market liquidity. Others see it as a necessary piece of regulation to ensure that financial institutions cannot repeat the financial meltdown of 2008. Callahan Erdoes said with the diminished role of the banks and investment dealers as investors and market makers, it would then fall to the shadow banking system, such as private equity and hedge funds, to grease the wheels of the global market. ""They have a lot of capital that could be deployed but they are not going to go in to make markets in the way banks used to. They are going in as a fiduciary, to make money for their investors, and those are the dynamics that everyone is struggling with,"" she said.",2019-01-25 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/25/ubs-ermotti-market-liquidity-could-freeze-like-the-water-in-davos-.html?&qsearchterm=,2,600

UBS says NASA's all-women spacewalk is a 'giant leap' with 'significant investment implications',"""NASA will make history with the first all-women spacewalk this month,"" UBS told investors.The event amplifies the messages of both space exploration and gender equality, UBS added, which ""are both likely to have significant investment implications.""The firm pointed to advancements by SpaceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic as ""important catalysts for the space economy.""","At the end of March a team of five women will break barriers in space, an event investment bank UBS thinks is more than symbolic: It's pivotal to investors. ""NASA will make history with the first all-women spacewalk this month,"" UBS said in a note to investors on Monday titled ""one giant leap for woman-kind."" The event amplifies the messages of both space exploration and gender equality, UBS added, which ""are both likely to have significant investment implications."" UBS pointed to research that gender equality ""will have major economic implications,"" the bank said. Narrowing the gap between the percentage of men and women participating in the global labor force could add $12 trillion to the world's GDP in the next six years, according to consulting firm McKinsey & Co.  Additionally, UBS found that companies where women make up at least 20 percent of either the board of directors or senior management ""were more profitable than their less gender diverse peers on several metrics,"" the firm said. The spacewalk on March 29 is being done to replace batteries on the outside of the International Space Station. NASA astronauts Anne McClain and Christina Koch will be performing the EVA (extravehicular activity). Back on Earth, flight director Mary Lawrence and flight controllers Kristen Facciol and Jackie Kagey will guide the pair of astronauts. Facciol first announced the all female spacewalk with a tweet on Mar. 1. @kfacciol tweet ""We are at a pivotal time in space exploration,"" UBS said. UBS pointed to advancements by SpaceX, Blue Origin and Virgin Galactic as ""important catalysts for the space economy."" Analyst Carl Berrisford said in a note in November that, while traditional contractors will continue to grow, ""the key growth catalyst for the space industry in the last two decades has come from the private sector."" Gwynne Shotwell, the president and COO of SpaceX, told CNBC in May that she hopes to inspire women to join space companies. When she was a teenager, Shotwell met a woman working as a female mechanical engineer. That woman became her role model and is the reason Shotwell now runs the day-to-day operations of one of the most valuable private companies in the world. ""I think it's important to be as public as I can afford to be and to hopefully inspire women to join me in this incredible field,"" Shotwell said. Last month, Virgin Galactic sent chief astronaut trainer Beth Moses as the company's first spaceflight test passenger. Beyond the commercial achievement, Moses became the first woman to fly in space on a U.S. commercial spacecraft. ""Today was the fulfillment of a personal lifelong ambition,"" Moses told CNBC. ""But more so, it was the start of something great for all of humanity – ourselves and other commercial companies, we are aiming to take people off the planet."" She added that ""aerospace is open to all professions.""

"Super fast travel using outer space could be $20 billion market, disrupting airlines, UBS predicts","In a decade, high speed travel via outer space will represent an annual market of at least $20 billion and compete with long-distance airline flights, UBS says.UBS expects the broader space industry, which is worth about $400 billion today, will double to $805 billion by 2030.Long haul airplane flights that are more than 10 hours in duration would ""be cannibalized"" by point-to-point flights on rockets, UBS said.","UBS believes there will be very lucrative ramifications from the space flight efforts currently led by Virgin Galactic, SpaceX and Blue Origin. A lengthy UBS report published on Sunday found that, in a decade, high speed travel via outer space will represent an annual market of at least $20 billion and compete with long-distance airline flights. Space tourism will be a $3 billion market by 2030, UBS estimates. ""While space tourism is still at a nascent phase, we think that as technology becomes proven, and the cost falls due to technology and competition, space tourism will become more mainstream,"" UBS analysts Jarrod Castle and Myles Walton wrote in the note. ""Space tourism could be the stepping stone for the development of long-haul travel on earth serviced by space."" UBS expects the broader space industry, which is worth about $400 billion today, will double to $805 billion by 2030 when accounting for these innovations. While these sub-sectors would be a small part of that, Castle and Walton said ""the outlook for the space economy, space tourism and long-haul travel using space has become much more bullish."" Private space companies ""are investing aggressively across the space opportunity,"" UBS said, and the firm believes access to space ""is the enabler to broader opportunities for investment."" Long haul airplane flights that are more than 10 hours in duration would ""be cannibalized"" by point-to-point flights on rockets, UBS said. The firm pointed to SpaceX's plans to use the massive Starship rocket it is building to fly as many as 100 people around the world in minutes. SpaceX said that Starship would be able to fly from New York to Shanghai in 39 minutes, rather than the 15 hours it takes currently by airplane. UBS estimates that there are more than 150 million passengers a year that fly routes longer than 10 hours. Last year, those routes saw 527,000 routes on airplane that had an average of 309 seats, UBS said. ""If we assume that 5 percent of these flights in the future are serviced by space at $2,500 per trip, the revenue opportunity as of today would be more than $20 billion per year as of today,"" UBS said  ""Although some might view the potential to use space to service the long-haul travel market as science fiction, we think ... there is a large market,"" UBS said. UBS noted that ""it is unlikely that a rocket will carry over 300 people anytime soon,"" so the Starship's capacity of 100 will be the maximum for the foreseeable future. However, UBS believes there may be an ""increased frequency of space travel during the day to enable the same volume of passengers,"" the firm said. ""Given the length of long-haul commercial travel, and the rules around crewing and take-off and landing time slot restrictions at airports, we think a re-usable rocket (especially if not land-based) would have materially better utilisation rates than a commercial plane,"" UBS said. As a result, UBS believes the $20 billion estimate ""could prove conservative,"" the firm said. More than 10 percent of people in a recent UBS survey said they would choose a spacecraft over an aircraft for long distance travel. ""While the timing of such a long haul service is uncertain, we think our base-case assumptions are conservative,"" UBS said. The billions of dollars pouring into private space companies represents ""a high level"" of capital formation, UBS said. Even though space tourism ""is still nascent,"" UBS said they believe the sub-sector ""will become mainstream as the technology becomes proven and cost falls."" To date, space tourism has largely been limited to the few flights organized by U.S.-based Space Adventures. Over the past two decades, the company has flown seven tourists using Russian Soyuz rockets. At a reported cost of more than $20 million per person, the private clients typically spent over a week on board the International Space Station. But now ""there are a number of commercial space ventures to open up suborbital travel,"" UBS noted. Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin are leading those efforts, both getting steadily closer to launching paying tourists. ""This area seems to be the market that has the greatest potential to gain traction quickly,"" UBS said. Virgin Galactic is deep into the development program of its spacecraft. Last month, the space venture owned by Sir Richard Branson sent test passenger Beth Moses on Virgin Galactic's spaceflight – a first for a private U.S. company. Virgin Galactic's spacecraft holds up to six passengers along with the two pilots. As the company has more than 600 would-be astronauts signed on to launch, Moses' work is key to preparing Virgin Galactic for commercial operations. Tickets for Virgin Galactic's flights are priced at $250,000 each. UBS believes Virgin Galactic's business model, as both a tourism company and manufacturer of spaceships, mimics the growth of businesses in the early days of aviation. ""In this way history could repeat itself as United Airlines today can trace back its roots to the Boeing Aircraft & Transport Company,"" UBS said. Blue Origin, the company founded by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, is also nearing its first spaceflights with human passengers. Blue Origin is developing the New Shepard rocket system for the company's space tourism business. As both Virgin Galactic and Blue Origin utilize reusable spacecraft systems, UBS believes the companies will be able to make space tourism ""a more common occurrence"" as reliability increases and prices decline. ""We estimate space tourism will be a $3 [billion plus per year] opportunity growing at double digit-rates,"" UBS said. ""This would be similar to what happened in commercial aviation, especially after the rise of low-cost airlines."" SpaceX could also see significant cash flow from space tourism, UBS believes, through two different ventures. Elon Musk's company just completed a historic test flight of its Crew Dragon capsule, which will be able to send as many as four astronauts to the space station. UBS estimates that NASA will pay SpaceX about $58 million on average per astronaut, compared to the $81 million per astronaut for flights on Russian Soyuz rockets. The second SpaceX opportunity is for early flights of Starship to send tourists on missions beyond the Earth's immediate orbit. In September, Musk announced Japanese billionaire Yusaku Maezawa signed with SpaceX to fly around the moon on Starship. Maezawa expects to fly in 2023, with six to eight guests joining him for the flight.",2019-03-18 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/18/ubs-space-travel-and-space-tourism-a-23-billion-business-in-a-decade.html?&qsearchterm=,27,1063
"First-quarter of this year one of the worst despite the global stocks rally, UBS' Ermotti says","The investment banking environment has seen one of the worst first quarters  in recent history, the CEO of UBS has warned, who told CNBC that he expects revenues to decline by about a third from a year ago.""I think that we are facing macro and geopolitical challenges that we all know, but in addition to that the first quarter was lacking any of the elements of positive seasonality this year,"" Sergio Ermotti, chief executive of UBS, told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche on Wednesday.","Despite the rally in global equity markets, revenues in the first-quarter of 2019 was one of the worst in recent years, CEO of Swiss-bank UBS told CNBC. ""I think that we are facing macro and geopolitical challenges that we all know, but in addition to that the first-quarter was lacking any of the elements of positive seasonality this year,"" Sergio Ermotti told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche on Wednesday. Ermotti said that while the first quarter in 2018 had been ""exceptional"" for both the industry as a whole and even more so for UBS, which he said had ""a very outstanding quarter"" - UBS reported a 19 percent jump in net profit in the first quarter of 2018, boosted by its investment banking division - the lender's investment banking division revenues were down by around a third in the first quarter this year. Investment banking is a specific division of banking related to the creation of capital for other companies, governments and other entities. ""The IB (investment banking unit) for us, last year, had an outstanding quarter so on a relative performance point of view most likely we will give away a little bit away of that extra performance, but in this environment, it's true that equity markets have recovered but the conviction level of both institutional and private clients is not there,"" he said. ""The Chinese market is up 25 percent and Hong Kong is up, U.S. is up ,but the volumes supporting that rally are not there,"" Ermotti added. Stocks have been on a tear since the Fed's last meeting in late January. In that time, the S&P 500 has risen more than 5 percent. The broad index is also up more than 12 percent for 2019 in part because investors expect less policy tightening for the year. The rally could extend further as several investors are still on the sidelines. A survey put together by Bank of America Merrill Lynch found the allocation of global stocks among respondents was the lowest since October 2016. Given the market's gains this year, investors underweight stocks could be enticed to increase their equity exposure, thus lifting prices even higher. At the forefront of investors' minds is the rates strategy of the U.S. Federal Reserve this year. The central bank had been expected to push ahead with monetary tightening this year but has faced pressure from President Donald Trump to not keep on hiking rates which he said would damage the U.S. economy. The Fed surprised many onlookers on Wednesday by holding rates steady and signalling that no more hikes would be coming this year, just three months after indicating that there could be two rate increases in 2019. There were four increases in 2018. They also pointed to at least another one before ending a round of policy tightening that began in December 2015. Ermotti told CNBC that the change of course was a potential headwind. ""It presents a headwind vis-a-vis our expectations for the year. We finished the year with an expectation that the Fed would hike a few times during the year now it's quite clear that they're going to pause ... the ECB has also reversed its stance. So I think what is more important is not a headwind vis-a-vis last year but most importantly, vis-a-vis plans and the expectations."" Rising rates are good for banks since they are able to lend out money to investors at a profitable rate of interest.

Ex-UBS broker sentenced in fraudulent Puerto Rico bond sales scheme,"Jose Ramirez will be the first person to serve jail time for their role in the scheme, which centered on sales of UBS proprietary closed-end bond funds.From January 2011 through September 2013, Ramirez advised his clients to improperly borrow money in order to invest in UBS Puerto Rico bond funds. The sales generated approximately $1.2 million in commissions.A CNBC investigation in December 2017 found that UBS was not forthcoming with its clients and brokers about the extent of the risks associated with its proprietary bond funds.","WASHINGTON — A former top broker in Puerto Rico for the Swiss banking giant UBS was sentenced to a year and a day in prison Tuesday, months after he pleaded guilty to criminal bank fraud for pocketing $1 million in commissions in a scheme that saw many investors lose their life savings. Jose Ramirez will be the first person to serve jail time for a role in the scheme, which centered on sales of UBS proprietary closed-end bond funds. In a near-empty courtroom in DC federal court, Ramirez asked Judge Thomas F. Hogan for leniency. ""I'm not here to blame anyone else,"" Ramirez, a 60-year-old father of three, told the judge. ""I ruined my record, my life and the lives of those who looked up to me."" The sentence was shorter than the 33-month maximum recommended by the government. Judge Hogan also ordered two years of supervised release, a $500 fine and granted Ramirez's request to voluntarily report to prison. ""I'm faced with a human being who has admitted his wrongdoings, and I think is remorseful for his actions,"" Judge Hogan said. Ramirez, who is known to many in Puerto Rico as ""The Whopper"" pleaded guilty in November 2018 for his role in a scheme to fraudulently obtain and misuse credit lines to purchase securities. ""UBS terminated the employment of Mr. Ramirez in January 2014, following an internal investigation that determined (1) he had permitted or encouraged clients to engage in improper conduct, and (2) had provided misleading responses to firm management when questioned about it,"" Peter Stack, a spokesman for UBS, said in an emailed statement According to the government, from January 2011 through September 2013, Ramirez advised his clients to improperly borrow money in order to invest in UBS Puerto Rico bond funds. The sales generated approximately $1.2 million in commissions. The use of the credit lines to purchase securities was not allowed by UBS Puerto Rico. However, Ramirez contends that he was not the only broker whose clients used the loans to purchase securities. He alleges in his sentencing memorandum that UBS ""was fully aware of the transactions"" and ""issued letters to at least seven financial advisors for knowing, allowing, or encouraging"" the scheme. Ramirez has been the only person prosecuted for the involvement in the scheme to date. The sales generated commissions when the credit lines were drawn down at UBS's Utah subsidiary and then again when the clients used the money to invest in the closed end funds managed by Ramirez. These highly levered funds were chock full of Puerto Rico bonds. By the end of June 2013, two separate bonds accounted for more than 90 percent of the net assets in 10 of UBS funds. At its peak, UBS had the largest wealth management business in Puerto Rico, representing an estimated 20,000 households. A CNBC investigation in December 2017 found that UBS was not forthcoming with its clients and brokers about the extent of the risks associated with its proprietary bond funds sold to residents on the island, even as the values of the funds plummeted. By 2012, UBS investors on the island had about $10 billion invested in the funds, or roughly 10 percent of the island's gross domestic product. In 2013, the bottom fell out of the Puerto Rico bond market, which caused a steep drop in the value of the bond funds. Many customers were forced to sell their bonds funds because they had no other available assets to meet account maintenance calls. That created significant losses. According to the government, the market collapse ultimately exposed Ramirez's scheme. Later that year, in August, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority permanently barred him from acting as a broker or associating with a broker-dealer firm after he failed to cooperate with regulators during his on-the-record testimony. According to court documents, Ramirez didn't answer the regulator's questions because he had invoked his Fifth Amendment right under the U.S. Constitution. He also asserted his constitutional right to remain silent in the legal proceedings for the SEC's civil case. Ramirez finally broke his silence this past Saturday when he named seven individuals, he alleges were either involved in, had knowledge of, or encouraged the transactions of the scheme. In his sentencing memorandum, Ramirez singled-out: Doel Garcia, a UBS executive, Ramiro Colon, a UBS Puerto Rico branch manager and his former supervisor, Carlos Ubinas, the chairman and president of UBS Puerto Rico, as well as four current or former UBS Puerto Rico brokers: David Lugo, Fernando Castillo, Leslie Highley and Luis Sanchez. In response to these allegations, a spokesman from UBS said: ""In its sentencing papers, the DOJ described Mr. Ramirez's offense as 'brazen', found that he took various steps to 'circumvent' UBS controls and to 'obscure' from UBS what he was doing, and found that Mr. Ramirez 'took advantage of all parties involved.' In light of these findings, Mr. Ramirez's last-ditch efforts to blame his victims for his own criminal conduct should be seen for what it is: an attempt to escape responsibility for his own wrongdoing."" CNBC reached out to lawyers or representatives of these individuals. Cory Jacobs, the trial attorney for the U.S. government, ""flatly objected"" to the assertion that Ramirez was made a ""scapegoat"" for the scheme. ""UBS did an internal investigation that identified the defendant as the hub of the fraud,"" Jacobs told Judge Hogan. He also said that people would go into UBS and ask for ""the whopper special."" Jacobs told the Judge that Ramirez had cooperated with the government during its investigation, but that the evidence and information he provided wasn't enough for the government to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that other bankers were knowingly engaged in the fraudulent conduct. UBS added in its statement to CNBC, ""UBS refutes any insinuation of wrongdoing by any of the people he has tried to implicate."" A lawyer for Lugo said, ""Mr Lugo did not engage in the activities for which Mr. Ramirez was charged, and to which Mr. Ramirez pled guilty. Nor was Mr. Lugo ever even charged with conducting such activity. Mr. Lugo's employment arbitration against UBS-PR was settled to the satisfaction of both UBS-PR and Mr. Lugo."" UBS has previously settled with FINRA and the SEC for roughly $34 million for charges involving the sales practices of the bond funds and failure to supervise. UBS has also paid out nearly $480 million to clients in FINRA settlements and awards as of January, with over 800 cases against UBS Puerto Rico still pending, according to data compiled by SLCG. In addition, the Swiss bank has disclosed in regulatory filings an ongoing investigation by the Department of Justice into the impermissible reinvestment of loan proceeds, in regard to the Puerto Rico funds. UBS says they are cooperating with the authorities.

There is ""increasing potential that Apple may not be able to ship a 5G iPhone for 2020,"" UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a note to investors on Tuesday. The delay in part comes from the lack of a smartphone processing chip compatible with 5G, according to Arcuri. UBS does not think Intel will be ready with a chip, while neither Samsung or MediaTek ""are unlikely solutions"" for Apple, Arcuri said.

While the lack of a 5G-capable iPhone may hurt Apple, Arcuri said a large number of users needing to replace old iPhones ""should soften any potential impact.""

He added that Apple ""remains steadfast in its estimate that actual upgrade rates are [less than] 3 years which suggest we are now actually below full replacement rates.""

In a note to clients this week, the investment firm said ""store rationalization needs to accelerate meaningfully as online penetration continues to rise."" Assuming online sales' share of total retail sales in the U.S. grows to 25% by 2026, from 16% today, roughly 75,000 more retail doors, excluding restaurants, need to close, analysts Jay Sole and Michael Lasser said. That means for every 1% increase in online penetration, roughly 8,000 to 8,500 stores need to close. A lot of that growth is being fueled by Amazon, which is expected to account for about half of the U.S. e-commerce market. Within that 75,000 number, about 21,000 clothing stores, 10,000 consumer electronics stores, 8,000 home furnishing stores and 1,000 home improvement stores should close, UBS estimated, based on the firm's assumed growth rates of online penetration within each retail subsector. It added about 7,000 grocery stores could close if online grocery penetration rises to 10%, from 2%, by 2026. UBS also analyzed the productivity of stores across the country, which it said accelerated through 2018, based on the amount of sales made per store. However, the firm said: ""We believe this pace of store productivity improvement is unlikely to be sustained in 2019 as the boost from fiscal stimulus fades. ... This will likely lead to an acceleration in physical store closures in the upcoming year."" Already this year, more than 5,000 store closures have been announced by retailers, according to a tracker by Coresight Research. They include Gap, Victoria's Secret, Charlotte Russe and Gymboree — notably many clothing companies. Lasser and Sole also said, however, that as more stores close ""it should help the store productivity of surviving locations.""",2019-04-09 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/04/09/75000-more-stores-need-to-close-ubs-estimates-as-online-sales-grow.html?&qsearchterm=,3,303
UBS names the price where the British pound becomes a 'buy',"The EU and the U.K. have agreed on a flexible extension of the Brexit deadline to Oct. 31.But the extension could open the door to general elections in the U.K., which could increase the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, said Tan Teck Leng, a foreign-exchange analyst at UBS Global Wealth Management.Such ""heightened uncertainty"" could send the British pound lower to 1.24 against the U.S. dollar, which is ""the opportunity for you to buy pound cheaper,"" Tan said.","""Heightened uncertainty"" over Britain's divorce with the European Union could be the trigger that sends the pound even lower, making it more attractive for investors to buy, according to UBS Global Wealth Management. The pound has been trading above the 1.30-level against the greenback over the past month. But increased uncertainty could send the sterling to levels of about 1.24 or 1.15 against the U.S. dollar, said Tan Teck Leng, a foreign exchange analyst at UBS. The EU and the U.K. on Thursday agreed to a flexible extension of the Brexit deadline, pushing it to Oct. 31. That would allow U.K. Prime Minister Theresa May more time to garner Parliament backing for a withdrawal agreement, take the country out without a deal, or cancel Brexit altogether. ""We don't think that Theresa May is able to get the current deal through the U.K. parliament. It is not likely to happen and with that, it opens the door to general elections,"" Tan told CNBC's ""Street Signs"" on Thursday. ""Is that higher or lower uncertainty? It is a lot higher because you don't know the parties, if they were to campaign, are they going to campaign on a harder Brexit or softer Brexit,"" he added. ""If you get a no-deal Brexit, it is not going to be 1.24, it is going to be 1.15 or below — that is the reality. Now, what can take the pound down to 1.24? The simple trigger would be just pure heightened uncertainty,"" he added. He explained that the U.K. heading into general elections will likely introduce greater volatility into the currency markets. That will result in the pound trading in a wider range, with the possibility of touching 1.24 against the U.S. dollar — that's ""the opportunity for you to buy pound cheaper,"" said Tan. Some investors have stayed away from trading the pound due to uncertainties on how the U.K. would leave the EU. Jasslyn Yeo, global market strategist at J.P. Morgan Asset Management, said she's been taking a ""wait-and-see"" approach on the currency. Yeo said she has also remained ""cautious"" on European stocks as a whole, partly due to Brexit. ""We continue to remain cautious on European equities especially over a 12- to 18-month time horizon. But that's not just because of Brexit, there are other reasons,"" she told CNBC's ""Capital Connection"" on Thursday. One concern cited by Yeo is the potential earnings disappointment among European companies. She explained that margins — an important driver for earnings — are likely to suffer because of higher wages in Europe. In addition, economic outlook for Europe is ""challenging,"" she said.

"Alphabet's self-driving car business, which just launched a commercial taxi service, could book $114 billion in revenue in 2030, says UBS","On the heels of Waymo's commercial launch on Wednesday, investment bank UBS estimates that Alphabet's self-driving car unit will reel in $114 billion in revenue in 2030.Waymo could monetize not only its taxi service, but also the eyeballs of riders, through entertainment or advertising, while also licensing its maps or autonomous vehicle operating system.UBS pegs Waymo's value at between $25 billion and $135 billion.","Waymo's first commercial pilot may be small, but Wall Street has big projections for the company's financial future. Alphabet's self-driving car unit could book $114 billion in revenue in 2030, according to a base-case estimate from investment bank UBS. In its self-driving taxi test in the suburbs around Phoenix, Waymo will charge a small number of people fares competitive with rides Lyft and Uber. But as Waymo adds more cars and locations, it could also license its maps and an autonomous vehicle operating system to other service or car-markers, or monetize the eyeballs of riders through entertainment or advertising, UBS analyst Eric Sheridan writes in a note to clients on Thursday. To put that $114 billion into perspective, Intel released a study in June of last year that projected that the self-driving space would generate $800 billion in cumulative revenue by 2035. UBS's estimate only included Waymo's revenue from robotaxi-related services, though Sheridan believes it has opportunities in logistics and commercial delivery as well. Aside from Waymo, a host of other tech and auto companies are racing to launch their own self-driving taxi services, including GM's Cruise and Uber. While Waymo's technology is widely seen as the most advanced, as highlighted by its Wednesday launch, there are still a host of regulatory and safety concerns on the table. Waymo's pilot will still include safety drivers to supervise rides, for example, at least initially. Overall, UBS pegs Waymo's total value between $25 and $135 billion, with a base case valuation of $75 billion. Morgan Stanley valued Waymo at $45 billion in August, with the potential to grow to $175 billion.

UBS chairman: Europe is running out of economic policy options to boost growth,"Following a synchronized global downturn last year, Europe is predicted to only achieve a slow rebound, Axel Weber, chairman of UBS said.In many European countries, including Italy and France, there's very little room for governments to use fiscal policy to stimulate the economy, Weber said.Europe's challenges go beyond the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies to boost growth and into areas such as trade relations with the U.S., innovation and Brexit, according to Weber.","Both emerging markets and the U.S. appear poised to recover from last year's economic stumbles, but problems persist for Europe, according to the head of global financial giant UBS. The continent is predicted to only achieve a slow rebound, Axel Weber, chairman of the Swiss investment bank, told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche in Washington D.C. on Thursday. ""We're a bit skeptical about the ability of Europe to use stimulus to come out of this,"" he said. ""I think there is some downside risk in Europe and you have to acknowledge that. So, whilst I do have the main outlook to be a sort of L-shaped recovery, stabilization at a lower level, growth below potential, I don't have the main scenario of a recession."" The International Monetary Fund recently downgraded growth in the euro zone. It now expects the bloc to grow at 1.3 percent in 2019 — lower than its forecast had been six months ago. In many European countries, including Italy and France, there's very little room for governments to use fiscal policy to stimulate the economy, Weber said. That's because their fiscal deficits are near the upper limit of the 3 percent of GDP that the European Central Bank allows. Only Germany has room for additional fiscal measures, but Berlin will only use it to boost the domestic economy, the UBS chief said. On the monetary policy front, the ECB has pumped trillions of euros into the economy over the past few years to boost inflation and promote growth. Earlier this week, the ECB held interest rates steady. ""What you have to ask yourself is: After years of quantitative easing, is adding more of the same really going to have the same impact on the economy that it did have when they started this? My answer to that is, probably not,"" Weber said. Europe's challenges, according to the UBS chief, go beyond the effectiveness of fiscal and monetary policies to boost growth. He pointed out three areas: First, European infrastructure and technology developments lag behind the U.S. and China. ""It needs to improve, and therefore needs investment into infrastructure, into digital economy, into 5G technology in order to catch up. They need to catch up fast and therefore they need to start investing now,"" he said. As Beijing and Washington inch closer to a trade deal, U.S. President Donald Trump recently took a swipe at the European Union. On Twitter, he called the EU a ""brutal trading partner with the United States,"" and declared that ""will change."" Trump tweet: Too bad that the European Union is being so tough on the United Kingdom and Brexit. The E.U. is likewise a brutal trading partner with the United States, which will change. Sometimes in life you have to let people breathe before it all comes back to bite you! Weber said Trump's shift in focus to Europe may invite renewed debate on trade relations. ""That all will not help the recovery in Europe because, as we have seen, if there are trade tensions, there's a higher uncertainty. It impacts negatively on investment and consumption and, therefore, it drags out any possible recover,"" he said. Brexit is also set to prolong uncertainty in Europe. While it presently looks unlikely that the U.K. will leave the EU without a deal in place (a so-called hard Brexit), the road ahead remains unclear, according to Weber. Brexit, he said, is still characterized by a huge amount of uncertainty on investment decisions, trade and location decisions. Earlier this week, EU leaders and the U.K. government agreed to a 'flexible extension"" of the Brexit deadline until Oct. 31. The U.K. was initially meant to leave the bloc on March 29 but was granted an extension to April 12 while the British Parliament failed to agree on any exit deal.

Net income for the first quarter came in at $1.1 billion, versus $848 million expected in a Reuters poll of analysts. However, this was lower than the $1.57 billion reported this time last year in what was a strong quarter for the bank. Here are the other key highlights of the first quarter of 2019: Sergio Ermotti, the group's chief executive officer, told CNBC Thursday that it was a ""very challenging quarter"" but he was ""pleased"" with the resilience of the results, nonetheless. The bank's wealth management division and its investment banking unit saw much lower operating profits than in the first quarter of 2018. The former registered an operating profit of $873 million, versus $1.1 billion a year ago. In investment banking, operating income fell to $221 million from $619 million a year ago. UBS said this was caused by the challenging trading environment, mainly in Europe and Asia. Speaking to CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche, Ermotti also said the bank outperformed in 2018 and this would have accentuated the 64% drop in profits at the investment banking unit. ""Last year, we outperformed all our peers across the board, and therefore the year-on-year comparison is quite challenging to us,"" he said. Despite a tough start in 2019, UBS expects economic growth and market performance to recover and stabilize in the coming months. ""We are likely to benefit from this environment ... Higher invested assets are expected to lead to an increase in recurring revenues in Global Wealth Management and Asset Management, compared with the first quarter of 2019,"" the bank said in a statement. Ermotti confirmed to CNBC Thursday that the Swiss bank aims to repurchase up to $1 billion in shares this year, as announced at the end of 2018. Shares rose 1.4% in early deals.  Media reports have suggested this week that UBS is in talks with the asset management division of Deutsche Bank about a potential merger. Ermotti told CNBC that he would not comment on the reports. ""We don't comment on rumors.

In a note published Monday, Barclays European banks analysts Amit Goel, Jun Yang and Krishnendra Dubey cut their price target for UBS by 6%, and suggested the bank may need a strategy overhaul to avoid weak profitability. However, they also noted that no imminent changes were expected.

UBS is currently targeting RoTE of 12.5% in 2019, although sell-side analysts do not currently expect the group to achieve this. Along with questions of organization, the note also questions whether more broadly, it would make sense to ""break up"" the UBS group, and whether the ""costs of size are more than outweighing the benefits?"" The analysts acknowledged the common justifications offered for weak profitability, including the global nature of the business and structural costs of spanning different jurisdictions. The fact that the group's U.S. business has a structurally low operating margin, but is ""tax efficient,"" was also cited along with the significant amount of capital tied up in the investment bank. However, the note called into question whether the current business model could optimize returns, and whether the profitability potential of the group could in fact decline further from here. The note suggested the profitability of UBS' wealth business is being ""diluted away"" and called into question the bank's heavy focus on its investment bank, along with its emphasis on ultra-high net worth (UHNW) clients.

Heightened tensions between Washington and Beijing do have the potential to undermine the U.S. economy and markets, and the UBS analysts would have expected a further 4.5% drag on earnings had the President Donald Trump administration followed through with all of its threatened tariffs last week. The U.S. on Friday delayed tariffs on cars and auto part imports for up to six months. The U.S. president has also threatened to put 25% tariffs on $325 billion in Chinese goods that remain untaxed.

Deutsche Bank shares hit record low as UBS downgrades stock to 'sell',"Pointing to tough external events and low rate environment, UBS slashed its price target for Deutsche from 7.80 euros ($7.45) to 5.70 euros.Deutsche faces pressure from investors to trim its investment bank division, especially after the collapse of merger talks with Commerzbank.Shares of Deutsche Bank are down nearly 5% since the start of this year. ","Shares of Deutsche Bank hit a record low Monday, down nearly 3%, after UBS downgraded the German lender's stock to a ""sell"" rating from ""neutral."" Pointing to tough external events and the low interest rate environment, UBS slashed its price target for Deutsche from 7.80 euros ($7.45) to 5.70 euros. ""We downgrade to sell because we don't expect operating conditions to improve anytime soon. Deutsche remains a levered market play vulnerable to external events and rising rates are currently a distant hope,"" UBS analysts said in a research note on Monday. Rising rates are good for banks since they are able to lend out money with a profitable rate of interest. Lower interest rates can restrict a bank's ability to make profits, adding pressure on margins. The German bank saw its stock hit to a record low of 6.673 euros on Monday morning, just days before its annual general meeting. Earlier this month, the shareholder advisory group Institutional Shareholder Services (ISS) called for stakeholders to issue a vote of no confidence in the management. Deutsche also faces pressure from investors to trim its investment banking division, especially after the collapse of merger talks with Commerzbank. Investment banking (IB) is a specific division of banking related to the creation of capital for other companies, governments and other entities. ""With the share price at close to all time lows, spreads and CDS (credit default swaps) stubbornly high and profitability depressed, the urgency to act is high we think,"" UBS said in its note that was published before the share price fall on Monday. ""DB's IB would have been a key beneficiary of a deal with Commerzbank, as it could have helped to drive down funding costs and spreads and balance the overall profile."" Deutsche Bank has been in the news for a variety of negative reasons in the past few years — from settlements with the U.S. Department of Justice, to management reshuffles, weak earnings, constant restructuring, merger speculation and steep stock price falls.  Shares of Deutsche Bank are down nearly 5% since the start of this year. The stock is down nearly 40% over a 12-month period and about 75% over a five-year period. Shares were also impacted by a report in the New York Times on Sunday that said Deutsche Bank ignored employees' calls to report Donald Trump transactions to a federal watchdog. Transactions in 2016 and 2017 triggered automated controls at Deutsche Bank meant to catch illicit activity, and compliance workers then prepared what's known as suspicious activity reports that they believed should be sent to the Treasury, according to the Times, which cited five current and former bank employees. But the reports were never filed with the government, the article states. Deutsche Bank denied these reports in a statement on Monday. ""At no time was an investigator prevented from escalating activity identified as potentially suspicious. Furthermore, suggestion that anyone was reassigned or fired in an effort to quash concerns relating to any client is categorically false."" Trump's relationship with Deutsche Bank has drawn scrutiny in Congress and elsewhere. Trump sued the bank last month to prevent it from complying with congressional subpoenas seeking information about potential suspicious payments. —CNBC's Hugh Son contributed to this report.",2019-05-20 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/20/deutsche-bank-shares-hit-record-low-as-ubs-downgrades-stock-to-sell.html?&qsearchterm=,4,537
"UBS cuts Apple price target, citing smartphone slowdown and ongoing trade war","The Swiss bank lowered its price target on the iPhone maker from $235 to $225.UBS still maintains a ""buy"" rating but said Apple is ""not immune"" from weaker smartphone demand globally and a U.S.-China trade war. UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri also flagged potential fallout from a Huawei battle.Apple shares are down 7% for the month as China and the U.S. remain locked in a stalemate on trade.","Slowing iPhone demand, trade war headwinds and possible ripple effects from a Huawei battle don't bode well for Apple, according to a UBS analyst. The Swiss bank cut its 12-month price target on the iPhone maker to $225 — down from a previous $235. Apple closed at $186 Thursday. UBS still has a ""buy"" rating on the stock but cited evidence from a survey of 8,000 people across six countries that suggests consumers are in no rush to upgrade their phones. For iPhones specifically, ""purchase intention"" looked to be stabilizing at a low level in all regions except China, UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri said in a note to clients Wednesday. ""We believe a slightly lower multiple is prudent given soft smartphone market and ongoing US/China trade issues,"" Arcuri said. Apple shares have taken a beating in May as Washington and Beijing remain locked in a stalemate on trade. Shares are down 7% for the month, as of Tuesday's close. The U.S. raised tariffs to 25% on $200 billions worth of Chinese goods earlier in May, and China retaliated by upping levies on $60 billion worth of U.S. imports. Most of Apple's supply chain is in mainland China, including the iPhone's final assembly by Foxconn. Apple's China business accounted for more than $10 billion — more than 17% of sales — in its fiscal second quarter. Arcuri also said the ""Huawei situation"" could indirectly impact Apple. On Thursday, the Wall Street Journal reported that a microchip company backed by Microsoft and Dell accused Chinese tech giant Huawei and one of its executives of stealing trade secrets. Last week, the U.S. Department of Commerce added the company to Entity List — meaning American companies would need a license to work with Huawei. ""Apple is not directly impacted, but relaxation of some sort is possible,"" Arcuri said. ""Negotiations between US/China are ongoing and an extension has been granted for some critical items, but we do think a nationalistic movement – similar to the one we saw at the time of the arrest of Huawei's CFO in November – seems quite probable and would impact iPhone sales."" UBS isn't the only one cautious on Apple. Earlier on Thursday, Goldman Sachs analyst Rod Hall said in a note to clients that Apple earnings could drop 29% if the company's products were banned in mainland China. To be sure, Arcuri said Apple would likely rebound in the event those headwinds ease. ""After a year that is impacted by China demand slowdown and elongating replacement cycles, we think iPhones can grow as these headwinds abate,"" Arcuri said. — CNBC's Fred Imbert contributed reporting.

US and China aren't facing 'enough pain' right now for them to strike a quick trade deal: UBS,"High-level trade negotiations between the U.S. and China broke down after President Donald Trump turned up the rhetoric against Beijing earlier this month.Beijing said last week that further talks can't proceed unless Washington adjusts its ""wrong actions"" but Trump still predicted that a deal could be reached ""fast.""However, Tan Min Lan, Asia-Pacific head of chief investment office at UBS Global Wealth Management, predicted that any deal between the U.S. and China will likely only come ""just before 2020.""","With both the U.S. and China avoiding any severe economic downturn so far, there's little incentive for the two countries to strike a trade deal quickly, according to UBS Global Wealth Management. High-level trade negotiations between the world's two largest economies broke down after President Donald Trump turned up the rhetoric against China earlier this month. Beijing said last week that further talks can't proceed unless Washington adjusts its ""wrong actions"" — but Trump still predicted that a deal could be reached ""fast."" At a media conference on Monday during his state visit to Japan, Trump said the U.S. is ""not ready"" to sign a deal with China but the two countries will have a ""great trade deal"" some time in the future. Tan Min Lan, Asia-Pacific head of chief investment office at UBS Global Wealth Management, predicted that any deal between the U.S. and China will likely only come ""just before 2020."" ""It's quite clear that trade tensions have re-escalated and at this point in time, there isn't enough pain on either side for a deal to be imminent,"" Tan told CNBC's ""Street Signs"" on Monday. ""If you look at United States, actually the economy is quite strong ... On the China side, we know that it is able to at least stabilize the economy."" Officials from Washington and Beijing were sending signals that trade talks were going well in the last few months before things turned tense in recent weeks. Trump unexpectedly accused China of reneging on a deal and announced that tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would increase to 25% from 10% on May 10. Beijing retaliated and raised levies on $60 billion worth of U.S. products. The Trump administration also put Chinese telecom giant Huawei on a blacklist that prevents it from buying from American companies without U.S. government permission. But there's still some impetus for both sides to strike a deal eventually, according to Tan. Trump, facing re-election in 2020, would want to boost his chances while the Chinese leadership would like to eliminate further economic uncertainties, said Tan. ""So, our sense is that you'll still get a deal probably just before 2020,"" she said, adding that any agreement between the U.S. and China must be seen as a ""win-win"" for Beijing — and not viewed as an American ""containment"" on the rise of Chinese power. The recent re-escalation in tensions between the U.S. and China has prompted UBS to reduce its investment portfolio's exposure to risky assets, according to Tan. Those changes include closing an ""overweight"" stance in emerging markets stocks and adding a ""short"" position on the , she added. For J.P.

Swiss financial giant UBS said Wednesday that it upgraded Malaysia to ""overweight"" from ""neutral."" It came one day after Europe's largest bank HSBC said in a report it had bumped up the Southeast Asian country to ""neutral"" from ""underweight."" Malaysia's stock benchmark, the Kuala Lumpur Composite Index, has lost around 5% so far this year — and is one of the worst-performing Asian emerging markets. Many foreign investors have stayed away from investing in Malaysia, citing concerns such as uncertainties surrounding the new government's economic agenda. But the country's resilience, especially at a time when tensions between the world's top two economies threaten to derail global growth, has convinced some investors to reconsider. ""We think the economy looks resilient, with domestic demand strong and manufacturing growth holding up. Low earnings growth is a concern but we see limited further downside. Valuations, while not as attractive as other markets in the region, are not particularly expensive,"" HSBC said in its report on Tuesday. ""The market has strong defensive qualities, which should reduce downside risks if trade tensions escalate,"" it added. That sentiment was shared by UBS, which said Malaysia fits the bill as a market that's ""defensive"" and offers ""safety"" amid the current global environment.

Goldman Sachs and UBS execs warn: Markets are 'overpricing' Fed rate cuts,"The markets are getting ahead of themselves in their expectations for the Federal Reserve to make cuts to its key interest rate, according to UBS Chairman Axel Weber and Goldman Sachs President and Chief Operating Officer John Waldron.Weber and Waldron are attending an Institute of International Finance meeting in Tokyo.""I think the market has overpriced the amount of rate cuts that the Fed is likely to do,"" Weber says.","Investors are getting too far ahead of themselves in expectations for the Federal Reserve to cut rates, according to a pair of top bankers at UBS and Goldman Sachs. Hopes for cheaper borrowing costs have spiked on the back of recent comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and other top officials at the U.S. central bank, sending U.S. stock markets soaring. But Axel Weber, chairman of Swiss bank UBS, said Thursday that traders may be misreading the tone of such remarks. ""I think the market has overpriced the amount of rate cuts that the Fed is likely to do,"" Weber said during a panel discussion at an Institute of International Finance meeting in Tokyo. ""If you listen to some of the key decision makers like Charlie Evans, if you listen to Jay Powell, there is no imminent rate cut,"" Weber said. ""There is likelihood if further weakness in the data evolves over the second half of the year that they might consider corrective action."" John Waldron, president and chief operating officer at Goldman Sachs, voiced similar concerns to CNBC's Nancy Hungerford. ""The market is pricing in a fairly substantial set of moves by the Fed,"" said Waldron, who was also attending the meeting. ""I worry a little bit that the market is too optimistic about how much and how soon the Fed will move."" Weber also said he doesn't see the Fed taking any precautionary rate cuts ""at this point."" But Weber, who is also chairman of the IIF, said it is clear the Fed stands ready to respond if it deems such action necessary. ""The fact that the U.S. has some room to maneuver, I think it would be unwise to assume that they will not use that room to maneuver if the economy substantially weakens. However, I think the current pricing in markets is overdone."" Waldron, appearing on the same panel as Weber, added that ""the market is certainly pricing in more than a hundred basis points in cuts now,"" citing options markets. But he projected that the Fed will ""be more reliant on the data than they will on the short-term sentiment."" Weber also suggested that there is some room for optimism if trade conflicts don't worsen. ""Should these tariffs not escalate, there is a lot of room for complete repricing in the markets and some upside related to that,"" he said. —CNBC's Yen Nee Lee contributed to this report.",2019-06-06 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/06/06/goldman-sachs-and-ubs-execs-markets-are-overpricing-fed-rate-cuts.html?&qsearchterm=,2,404

That may not be the case. That's the message from UBS ahead of the Fed's policy decision on Wednesday. Traders are betting that the central bank would deliver an easing of monetary policy soon to provide the economy with some insurance and hence boosting stocks, but UBS believes such a move would do little to lift the market. ""When it comes to U.S. stocks, the Fed put is dead,"" UBS equity strategist Francois Trahan said in a note Monday. ""In the past 20 years, the so-called 'Fed Put' has failed to revive equities the way rate cuts did in the 1990s. The two easing cycles of this millennium took place amidst severe declines in equities."" The correlation between the 's price-earnings ratio and the fed funds rate has broken due to the long period of low rates since the early 2000s, UBS noted. When the Fed slashed rates in 2001 and 2008 to salvage the economy from recessions, U.S. equities did not rally after the rate reductions. In fact, the S&P 500 fell as much as 16% in the 12-month period after the cuts, the bank pointed out.  The market has been increasingly betting on a rate cut ever since Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the central bank will ""act as appropriate to sustain the expansion.""

Meanwhile, stocks have fully come back from the May turmoil with the S&P 500 up more than 16% so far this year and about 1% from its all-time high hit in late April. Unlike in the 1990s when the S&P 500 P/E ratios responded to the interest rate changes, now they are behaving ""very cyclical,"" meaning being driven by leading economic indicators, UBS said. ""This does not bode well for equities as it suggests that P/Es will likely continue to compress as long as leading indicators of the economy continue to slow. Fed rate cuts are unlikely to change any of this in the near term,"" Trahan said.

"CME's plan for bitcoin futures mirrors moment just before the 1637 tulip bubble crash, UBS says","UBS economist Paul Donovan said plans for bitcoin futures contract mirror the situation just before the tulip bubble burst in the 1600sCME Group announced plans to introduce bitcoin futures contracts, pending regulatory approvalThe price of bitcoin soared above $7,000 to hit a new record high","CME Group announced plans for bitcoin futures contracts earlier this week, a move that UBS analyst Paul Donovan has compared to the introduction of a similar product just before the tulip bubble burst in the 1600s. The tulip craze in the Netherlands in the 17th century saw the price of the flower skyrocket. This resulted in a crash of that market in 1637. In 1636, cash-settled futures were introduced in the tulip market. A futures contract is one where a buyer and seller will agree a price for a commodity that will be delivered on a certain date. This previously meant that the physical product had to be delivered. But cash-settled futures contracts allow cash to be delivered upon expiration. This method was used during the tulip bubble and a year later in 1637, the market crashed. The CME Group said earlier this week that it plans to launch bitcoin futures in the fourth quarter, pending regulatory review. Those futures will be based on cash settlement too. Donovan, wealth management global chief economist at UBS, said: ""We've been here before."" TWEET In a follow-up email to CNBC, Donovan explained the issues with the cash-settled futures contracts for tulips and how that compares to bitcoin.  ""The idea of not physically delivering the product was rather shocking to contemporaries (as it turns out, the market crashed before bulbs could have been delivered anyway – bulbs were lifted in June 1637 for physical delivery). Traders met in groups (in taverns), called 'Colleges.' Think of the taverns as the cryptocurrency exchanges of their day,"" Donovan said. UBS has been been one of the bearish voices on bitcoin. In a research paper published last month, the investment bank said that bitcoin is a ""speculative bubble"" and will never be a real currency.  Bitcoin has often been compared to the tulip craze. Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, called the cyrptocurrency a ""fraud"" and said ""it's worse than tulip bulbs"" and ""won't end well."" The cryptocurrency continues to rally.

While escalation isn't what UBS expects, a failed meeting between President Donald Trump and China's Xi Jinping that results in a new wave of tariffs would mean ""major"" changes to global GDP and market forecasts, global head of economic research Arend Kapteyn wrote in a note. If the trade war escalates, ""we estimate global growth would be 75bp lower over the subsequent six quarters and that the contours would resemble a mild 'global recession' —similar in magnitude to the Eurozone crisis, the oil collapse in the mid-1980s and the 'Tequila' crisis of the 1990s,"" he wrote. The impact of a scuttled trade deal at the U.S.-China meeting in Osaka and agitated relations wouldn't be felt immediately, however, but grow in severity over several quarters as higher prices stifle demand and growth, the UBS researcher wrote. In the United States, the cumulative reduction in GDP would be about 1% over six quarters, 1.2% in China and 0.74% in Europe, Kapteyn wrote.  Source: UBS U.S. and Chinese negotiators are expected to begin discussions in Osaka this week before Trump and Xi meet, hoping to quell inflamed relations between Washington and Beijing, which have crumbled since late April. In a surprise move, Trump tweeted on May 5 that tariffs on $200 billion worth of Chinese goods would increase to 25% and that another 25% tariff would ""shortly"" be imposed on an additional $325 billion of imported goods from China. Traders blamed the worsened trade outlook for an equity pullback in May, with the S&P 500 down 6.5% last month. But further aggravation of the trade conflict could push global equities down 20%, Kapteyn said, with the prior U.S. outperformance relative to Europe eroding and emerging markets taking a heavy hit.

""For a bottom up perspective, we lean on our prior work to highlight trade and crowded growth exposed stocks.""  Source: U.N.

Such a push would pressure the yield on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note below its record low of 1.3%, the UBS economist predicted. In China, the government would add another 150 basis points of total social financing growth, with GDP falling under 6%. China's total social financing is a catchall term for lending by banks and other institutions.

London stock exchange could halt trading of Swiss companies like UBS amid EU standoff,"According to a notice released Tuesday night, the exchange could halt trading in as many as 254 equity securities issued by Swiss companies.Switzerland and the EU are embroiled in an ongoing dispute regarding long-standing financial, immigration and trade ties between the two, since Switzerland is not a member of the bloc. The stock market equivalence granted to Switzerland by the EU expires at the end of June.","The London stock exchange (LSE) has warned investors they could be forced to halt the trading of Swiss stocks from Monday due to a political standoff between Switzerland and the European Union (EU). According to a notice released Tuesday night, the exchange could halt trading in as many as 254 equity securities issued by Swiss companies.  All of the shares are currently traded on the London Stock Exchange's MTF XLOM, a multilateral trading facility. MTFs are part of the European Union regulatory framework and provide an alternative to traditional stock exchanges, so none of the companies are listed on the main London Stock Exchange. Similar warnings have also been issued by exchange operators Aquis Exchange, CBOE Global Markets and UBS. Switzerland and the EU are embroiled in an ongoing dispute regarding long-standing financial, immigration and trade ties between the two, since Switzerland is not a member of the bloc. The stock market equivalence granted to Switzerland by the EU expires at the end of June. If the deadline passes on Sunday without an agreement on the EU's new political demands, and the bloc decides not to extend, the LSE notice explained that ""it is likely the Swiss authorities will remove the recognition that allows EU trading venues to offer trading in the Swiss equity securities."" European venues would face restrictions to trading in Swiss companies, including blue chip giants such as Nestle, UBS and Novartis, on Monday if Switzerland is not granted equivalence by the start of trading. A Nestle spokesperson told CNBC that the company is ""observing the situation"" but does not anticipate a ""significant impact"" on its shares. The obligation has been applicable to foreign trading venues if they admit shares of Swiss registered companies since January 1, but the Swiss Federal Department of Finance issued a statement Monday indicating that it is prepared to withdraw the recognition of EU venues. ""Trading venues in the EU would thus be prohibited from offering or facilitating trading in certain shares of Swiss companies from that date,"" the statement said.. ""Activating the protective measure with regard to trading venues in the EU serves solely to protect the functioning of the Swiss stock exchange infrastructure."" If the two parties fail to agree new terms in the ensuing days, investors face the prospect of a major overhaul, since Swiss companies comprise around one fifth of the Stoxx 50 index by market capitalization. For several years, the EU has been trying to implement a new framework consolidating over a hundred bilateral treaties governing ties between Brussels and Bern into one accord, in order to ensure the Swiss cannot renege on obligations such as immigration without losing EU market access. The EU's bargaining chip was a change to the way it grants market access, or equivalence, allowing Swiss companies to be traded on European exchanges. Switzerland received a one-year extension to agree to Brussels' demands in late 2017, and a further six-month extension at the end of 2018, which expires on Sunday, June 30. Beat Wittmann, partner at Zurich-based Porta Advisors, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Wednesday that the Swiss had more to lose from a fraying of relations. ""Switzerland has the most complex bilateral arrangement which served both sides pretty well, and quite frankly the Swiss only got away with this because we are relevant economically, prudent financially and very export sensitive, but we are not a big power at the table,"" he said. Wittmann added that while the equivalence discussion is ""only a little part of the great picture,"" the issue was heating up ahead of Swiss elections this fall, with ""nationalist and populist forces"" keen to capitalize on anti-EU sentiment.

Improved deliveries in the second quarter could drive Telsa shares in the near term but second-quarter profits and deliveries in the second half of the year are keeping UBS cautious on Tesla's stock. UBS maintained its sell rating on the stock and lowered its 12-month price target to $160 from $200. Tesla's stock was slightly higher Friday  at $223.35. ""Deliveries may provide a pop, but earnings may cause a drop,"" UBS analyst Colin Langan said in a note to clients. ""We expect losses in the second half to increase as deliveries likely soften and the impact of pricing actions continues to weigh on margins."" Tesla's decline in deliveries in the first quarter worried investors and pressured shares. Shares of the automaker fell by more than 10% after the company said it delivered 63,000 vehicles in the first quarter, while analysts were expecting Tesla to deliver about 76,000 cars. UBS said if Tesla can show a strong recovery in deliveries in the second quarter, close to its 90,000 to 100,000 target, ""it would likely appease bulls,"" Langan said. However, UBS is expecting a larger earnings loss in the second half of 2019. Langan lowered Telsa's earnings per share estimates for the rest of 2019 until 2023. UBS cut Tesla's second-quarter earnings-per-share estimate to a loss of 78 cents from a loss of 49 cents. Langan said a key concern for margins is the $2,400 average estimated Autopilot price cut. There will be a profit decline per car and 70% of buyers chose the autopilot option, UBS estimates. ""As we expect margin headwinds & slowing deliveries, we remain bearish,"" said Langan.  Shares of Tesla have suffered in 2019. The automaker's stock is down 32% this year.

"Central banks' key policy goals are under threat from climate change, warns UBS","Although the study revealed that central banks are ""conscious of their fiduciary duty"" to the public, just 9% have taken specific measures related to climate risk which go beyond basic requirements within broader environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks required by most public institutions.A detailed report from UBS global sovereign market strategists Massimiliano Castelli and Philipp Salman suggested ""there is growing empirical evidence that climate risk affects the two policy goals pursued by the central banks.""","Central banks around the world must proactively fight climate change in their own investment portfolios in order to safeguard their key priorities, according to research. A survey of central banks, carried out by UBS Asset Management, revealed that 62% believed a fiduciary duty to the general public was a key motivation for working climate risk into the management of their own assets. However, while 56% said they had noticed increased interest from peers in environmental issues, only 6% indicated that they had experienced increased scrutiny from politicians or supervisory bodies regarding the inclusion of climate risk criteria in their own investment processes. Although the study revealed that central banks are ""conscious of their fiduciary duty"" to the public, just 9% have taken specific measures related to climate risk which go beyond basic requirements within broader environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks required by most public institutions. Such frameworks require institutions and companies to document the broader impact of their operations on each of these three criteria, and serve as an indicator of future financial performance in terms of risk and reward. Two-thirds of central banks indicated that technical difficulties due to a lack of available benchmarks to represent ESG impact were the key obstacles to including climate considerations in their portfolios. Just over half suggested they would only accept lower returns if the respective benchmark was changed, while 72% indicated they would not be willing to take a more active ownership approach that required greater engagement with companies. Despite the apparent lack of engagement thus far, a detailed report from UBS global sovereign market strategists Massimiliano Castelli and Philipp Salman suggested ""there is growing empirical evidence that climate risk affects the two policy goals pursued by the central banks."" This first of these is physical risk. Extreme weather events and climate pattern disruptions impact financial stability via negative impacts on the banking and insurance sectors, the report suggested. However, such events can also impact the monetary stability goal, as ""they have the potential to increase uncertainty with regards to inflation and growth forecasts which are the basis for the setting of interest rates,"" it added. The second, transition risk, refers to policy evolution through time and across governments on climate risk, which also affects central banks. ""The corporate and financial sectors will have to adapt to the evolving policy and regulatory framework surrounding climate risk - i.e. reduction of CO2 emissions and carbon pricing - but significant uncertainty exists about the forms and the timing of these changes,"" the UBS report stated. ""What is certain is that these policies will create disruption as institutions adapt, potentially impacting both the financial stability and monetary policy goals of central banks."" Climate risk also affects the asset management operations of central banks, as with any other institutional investor's portfolio. States and sectors adjusting to new climate change realities could mean central banks face losses on asset holdings exposed to climate risk, the economists highlighted. Risk mitigation operations, such as re-allocating assets to holdings with less exposure to climate risk or stronger ESG focus, will therefore be necessary. Castelli and Salman highlighted the Dutch Central Bank (DNB), the Bank of England and the People's Bank of China as being at the vanguard of driving green finance measures. Almost half (45%) of respondents to the UBS Annual Reserve Manager Survey 2019 suggested that the inclusion of climate risk criteria in asset management activities would be achieved through an exclusion list. The asset classes where central banks see greater scope for climate risk inclusion are corporate and government bonds. ""The results of our RMS survey hint that most prefer to implement — or, in many cases, have already implemented — a comprehensive ESG framework with the help of established data providers,"" Castelli and Salman wrote. ""A major contribution central banks can provide in the greening of the financial system is to create standards and an international level playing field.""",2019-07-02 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/02/central-banks-key-policy-goals-are-under-threat-from-climate-change-warns-ubs.html?&qsearchterm=,4,653
"Investors should buy Chinese internet stocks, UBS and Credit Suisse say","Although Chinese internet companies have seen their stocks stumble, two global investment banks say the sector appears to be a solid bet.""Internet is essentially a structural growth story in China.

Technology has emerged as a heated battleground in the ongoing U.S.-China trade conflict as both countries seek to dominate new areas like 5G and artificial intelligence. Amid that, Chinese internet companies have seen their stocks stumble. Still, John Woods, Credit Suisse's chief investment officer for Asia Pacific, said the sector appears to be a solid bet. ""Internet is essentially a structural growth story in China. We don't see it changing anytime soon,"" Woods told CNBC on Tuesday. ""It sold off aggressively ... from mid-April. So we feel there's upside in that particular sector."" That assessment was also expressed by UBS Global Wealth Management in a briefing in Singapore on Monday. Tan Min Lan, the head of the Asia Pacific Investment Office at UBS Global Wealth Management, said that Chinese internet companies offered ""solid share buyback prospects"" and have high cash flows. Although Chinese tech companies such as Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba have been exposed to U.S.-China trade tensions, Woods pointed out that they are largely focused on the domestic market. ""Clearly we want to focus on those names and those sectors within that broad group which have a profound domestic focus. Actually, the internet stocks do have an overwhelmingly domestic focus. They are not really export-oriented,"" Woods said. ""They're absolutely focused on consumption plays, services plays within the domestic economy and those are the ones we want to focus on."" UBS' Tan, too, pointed to the domestic focus of those stocks as a strength. ""We still like software and services, and we like internet because the bulk of the revenues is generated domestically,"" she said. The KraneShares CSI China Internet exchange-traded fund, which tracks Chinese tech stocks including Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba, tumbled in May as the U.S and China ratcheted up tariffs on each other's goods, before rebounding slightly beginning in June. Beyond internet companies, Woods highlighted two other sectors in China that are set to perform well: insurance and infrastructure. Infrastructure will ride on the Chinese government's efforts to stimulate the economy, he said. With the slowing domestic growth, Beijing has ramped up fiscal spending, including in infrastructure projects. As for insurance, the sector will tap on the aging trend in China, Woods said. ""It reflects the dramatic aging we're seeing right now in China, the need for insurance, particularly health insurance,"" he told CNBC. — CNBC's Elizabeth Schulze contributed to this report.",2019-07-09 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/09/investing-ubs-and-credit-suisse-recommend-chinese-internet-stocks.html?&qsearchterm=,4,414

UBS reports best second quarter in nine years but warns against 'sharp drop' in interest rates,The Swiss-lender announced that this is the highest second-quarter net profit since 2010. The profit boost comes in despite declines in both its investment bank and wealth management divisions.UBS said that a return to monetary stimulus from various central banks could dent profits going forward.,"UBS announced a net profit of $1.4 billion for the second quarter of 2019. This compared to a net profit of 1.28 billion Swiss francs ($1.29 billion) in the second quarter of 2018. The Swiss-lender announced that this is the highest second-quarter net profit since 2010. The profit boost comes in despite declines in both its investment bank and wealth management divisions. Here are some key highlights for the quarter: ""We saw a normalization of the environment coming out of a good March into the rest of the quarter. I'd say the highlights were clearly: diversification paid off again,"" Sergio Ermotti, chief executive officer of UBS told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche. UBS shares hovered around the flatline shortly after the market open. UBS, however, saw a decline in its global wealth management business compared to a year ago. The bank reported an operating profit of $886 million compared to over $1 billion in the second quarter of 2018. Profits in its investment bank division also fell from a year ago. It registered an operating profit of $440 million in the second quarter for this year compared to $571 million a year ago. Speaking to CNBC, Ermotti explained that ""the u-turn in the interest rate environment in the U.S. has created pressure."" Market expectations point to an interest rate cut by the Federal Reserve later this month. The central bank had embarked on a normalization path in 2015, after the global and sovereign debt crises. However, recent data has shown worsening economic conditions in the U.S. In Europe, the outlook is similar for monetary policy. The European Central Bank (ECB) said in May that if incoming economic data does not show an improvement, then the central bank will be prepared to announce more stimulus. Ermotti told CNBC that he is not sure whether further easing will propel the economy. ""I'm not sure going deeper into negative territory or using the QE (quantitative easing) is the way to get out of the problems…We need more structural answers,"" he said. Ermotti warned ""there are severe broader considerations than just the banking industry"" from low rates. Ermotti's comments come in after the Swiss-lender warned in its latest results that a return to monetary stimulus from various central banks could dent profits going forward. ""A sharp drop in interest rates and expected rate cuts will continue to adversely affect net interest income compared with last year,"" UBS said. However, the Swiss bank expects that a diversified business, stronger investor sentiment and higher market volatility will help offsetting impacts from changes to monetary policy. In the previous quarter, UBS had announced that cutting an extra $300 million from its 2019 costs after anticipating the fall in revenues. ""We constantly look at ways from a structural and tactical point of view, and the 300 million were pretty much tactical.

"If Boris Johnson shifts his Brexit plans, the pound could trade 'north of $1.35,' says UBS","Incoming British Prime Minister Boris Johnson may need to rethink his stance on Brexit, given Parliament's opposition to a so-called hard Brexit, a UBS investor projects.""Being a prime minister, things can change, and so maybe we also think about a little bit of an extension to the Brexit negotiation,"" Dominic Schnider tells CNBC's ""Squawk Box.""Should Johnson soften his perspective on Brexit, the pound may ""trade north of $1.30, $1.35,"" Schnider says.","Incoming British Prime Minister Boris Johnson may need to rethink his stance on Brexit, given Parliament's opposition to a so-called hard Brexit, a UBS investor projected on Wednesday. That's likely to impact the weakened pound, he said. Johnson, who won the race to the lead country on Tuesday, previously said the U.K. must leave the European Union by Oct. 31 ""do or die, come what may."" But that may not continue to be his outlook as he weighs the best path forward. ""Being a prime minister, things can change, and so maybe we also think about a little bit of an extension to the Brexit negotiation,"" Dominic Schnider, head for commodities and Asia Pacific foreign exchange at UBS Global Wealth Management, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box."" Should Johnson soften his perspective on Brexit, there will be consequences for the British pound, Schnider projected. ""If the market realizes that the hard Brexit probability starts to shrink, I think the pound can come back. So we're probably going to trade north of $1.30, $1.35, somewhere there,"" Schnider said. The pound closed at $1.2436 on Tuesday, edging near the two-year trough of $1.2382 it brushed last week. The pound is down more than 13% since the U.K. voted to leave the EU on June 23, 2016.  Recent sterling lows have been attributed to Johnson's insistence on Brexit. ""In our view, Johnson's desire to push for Brexit, deal or no deal, increases the chance of an early general election and some possibly (of) nasty GBP outcomes,"" Rodrigo Catril, senior foreign exchange strategist at National Australia Bank, wrote in a recent note. A reduced probability of an upcoming British election, due to disagreements on Brexit between Parliament and Johnson, could also give the pound a lift, Schnider told CNBC. However, he noted that it wasn't necessarily the election's outcome that would make a difference to sterling. What's more important for traders, he said, is the sentiment about whether ""the U.K. and European Union jointly try to solve this issue and not depart in an unfriendly way."" A ""no-deal"" Brexit, which investors are concerned will happen come Halloween, will mean the U.K. leaves the European bloc without reaching a formal deal. That is, there would be no transitional period for the British government to negotiate free trade deals.

""We believe that investors can keep their investment strategies on track for the long term even in the current uncertain times without retreating to cash,"" UBS global chief investment officer Mark Haefele said in a note to clients Wednesday. Economic uncertainty reigns as the trade war between the U.S. and China has placed increasing strain on the global economy, prompting policymakers to respond with interest rate cuts and stimulus measures to bolster growth. Investors are searching for safe havens amid the uncertain landscape; however, Haefele said a retreat into cash is not the solution. ""A high allocation to cash over the longer term increases the risk that investors will fail to achieve their financial goals,"" he wrote. Instead, the firm recommends a broad range of defensive strategies to protect long-terms gains, such as high and sustainable dividend stocks and gold. ""Dividend investing is a defensive investment style that generates regular cash flows for investors and tends to outperform when markets are volatile,"" said Haefele. Dividend stocks tend to perform well in low interest rate environments and are more stable than earnings, he added. Gold is a historically safe trade when rates are low, stocks are volatile and the dollar is weak. UBS expects the precious metal to breach the $1,600 level in six months and said adding gold can provide stability to investor portfolios.

UBS sees 'potential for resolution' in the US-China trade talks despite current 'volatility',"On Friday, Chinese representatives in Washington to discuss trade ahead of next month's high-level talks cancelled a planned trip to meet with U.S. farmers.""You have to look through these because there've been ups and downs in these negotiations, there's been a lot of volatility on both sides about these negotiations,"" said Axel Weber, UBS chairman.Both the U.S. and China would not be spared from such adverse economic impact — that's one of the factors that would continue to prod both parties to return to the negotiating table, predicted Weber.","Negotiations between the U.S. and China may appear volatile at times, but there's still a chance the two countries could resolve their differences over the longer term, the chairman of UBS said on Saturday. Investors have been following developments around the trade negotiations for signs on where the tariff conflict is headed. On Friday, Chinese representatives, who were in Washington to discuss trade ahead of next month's high-level talks, unexpectedly cancelled a planned trip to meet with U.S. farmers. It was a development that sent the S&P 500 down slightly. ""You have to look through these because there've been ups and downs in these negotiations, there's been a lot of volatility on both sides about these negotiations,"" Axel Weber, chairman of the Swiss wealth management giant, told CNBC's Nancy Hungerford at the Singapore Summit. ""What we're interested in is the long term developments and whilst there is a big dispute at the moment, I think there's also potential for resolution. And the potential for resolution lies in the very fact that trade is really beneficial to both sides,"" he said. The U.S.-China trade war, which started more than a year ago, has hurt business confidence and is often cited as one of the bigger risks to the global economy. The International Monetary Fund, for one, warned that elevated tariffs as a result of the U.S.-China dispute could shave 0.8% off global economic output in 2020 — and potentially result in further losses in the following years. Both the U.S. and China would not be spared from such adverse economic impact — that's one of the factors that would continue to prod both parties to return to the negotiating table, predicted Weber. Like Blackstone Executive Vice Chairman Tony James, the UBS chairman said the two countries could reach ""an agreement that will sort out certain developments"" and leave other sticking points for further negotiations. In addition to the impact on economic growth, some experts have warned the U.S.-China bilateral fight could split the technology world in two. But Weber said that divide has existed from the very beginning, with China having developed technology platforms such as those by Chinese social media platform, WeChat, and e-commerce giant Alibaba, which are similar to Facebook and Amazon in the U.S. The trade war looks likely to reinforce those divisions — which is also bad news for the global business community, he added. ""There's very little expectation ... that Chinese consumers are going to move away from those to equivalent platforms to U.S.-like platforms,"" he said. ""So, we're not facing a new reality. We're facing a bipolar system ... my expectations is it will not further integrate."" — Reuters contributed to this report.",2019-09-23 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/23/look-past-the-volatility-in-us-china-trade-talks-ubs-axel-weber.html?&qsearchterm=,2,448
"Boeing and Airbus to see reduced jet demand as climate awareness grows, UBS says",Consumers are increasingly factoring in climate concerns when considering taking a flight says UBS.Jet demand could reduce as airlines witness fewer ticket sales.UBS sees biofuels as a main strategy for long-haul travel.,"Rising concern about commercial flying's impact on the environment will act as a brake on passenger growth and reduce jet sales from the likes of Boeing and Airbus, according to a new report from UBS. A survey of more than 6,000 people has revealed that a growing number of travelers in Europe and America have already reduced the number of flights they took over the last 12 months because of heightened environmental awareness. Around one in four flyers in France, Germany and the U.S revealed to UBS that they had reduced flights. A smaller number of Brits (16%) admitted that climate change had forced them to forego at least one trip. Chief author of the report's findings and UBS's Head of European Industrials Equity Research, Celine Fornaro, added in the note Monday that around 27% of respondents were now ""thinking about it,"" when asked if climate worries could affect travel plans. That figure marked a rise from a similar survey taken by UBS in May which came out at 20%. Moves are afoot from European governments to discourage flying. France is to soon introduce a 1.50 euro levy on domestic tickets, rising to 18 euros ($20) on long haul travel. Germany is to double its taxes for flights originating from Germany from January next year and Switzerland is another country proposing a flight tax. UBS's model predicts that the upshot of personal concern allied to increased cost will reduce intra-European traffic growth over the next 20 years to 1.5% per year versus the 3% per year currently estimated by Airbus. Airbus also predicts air traffic within the U.S. will grow 2.1 percent each year through to 2038 but UBS trims that to 1.3% as people look for alternatives to taking a plane. China is tipped to soon be the world's largest aviation market but while Chinese respondents were not asked, the Swiss bank's researchers put forward the possibility that huge investment in train travel across China will slow the expected boom in flights. Airbus's most recent forecast says almost 11,000 new small jets will be needed to serve European and U.S. demand over the next two decades, but UBS believes that number should shrink by 7%. The bank says that in Airbus' case that could mean a reduction in revenue of almost 3 billion euros each year. Around three-quarters of respondents said they would be happy to fly in an electric or hybrid plane but only one in four said they would feel comfortable in a smaller self-piloted aircraft as a means of travel. A partially-electric regional plane is predicted by some in the industry to be around ten years away, but UBS believe battery technology may not develop to the point that can power larger craft. The researchers consider alternative biofuels as the most realistic option for long haul flights and noted efforts by California and Oregon to set new rules on carbon fuel standards for the transport sector. UBS noted however that while ""alternative fuels"" generate fewer emissions while being produced, once in the sky they emit similar levels of CO2 to traditional jet fuel.",2019-09-30 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/30/boeing-and-airbus-to-see-reduced-plane-demand-as-climate-awareness-grows.html?&qsearchterm=,9,517

In fact, the S&P 500 has fallen slightly since the central bank delivered the first rate reduction in more than a decade in July. That's because the correlation between the S&P 500's price-earnings ratio and the Fed funds rate has broken due to the long period of low rates since the early 2000s, UBS noted ""Fed rate cuts are not likely to fuel equities higher as they did in the 1990s,"" UBS equity strategist Francois Trahan said in a note on Tuesday. ""The Fed-easing rallies of the 1990s were made possible by a strong inverse correlation between interest rates and P/Es. This relationship no longer exists today."" Stocks just finished a volatile third quarter with the S&P 500 still eking out a small gain. Investors had a choppy ride over the past few months with the escalated trade war taking a bite from the economy. The U.S. manufacturing sector contracted in August, its first decline since 2016, according to a gauge from the Institute for Supply Management. ISM's new export orders also slowed to their lowest reading since April 2009, which is an important signal as the decline has historically been coincided with S&P 500 earnings growth turning negative, the analyst pointed out. ""Investor sentiment has been resilient in the face of the ISM crossing below 50 in August. We believe this resilience in sentiment is explained by the widespread belief that Fed rate cuts will help support S&P 500 P/Es as they did in the 1990s,"" Trahan said. Traders are now pricing in a 40% chance of a rate cut at the end of October and about a 67% probability of at least one rate reduction in December, according to CME FedWatch tool. Optimism for a rate-cut rally should be further diminished in the face of heightened political uncertainty, Trahan warned.

The bank's net profit attributable to shareholders for the third quarter came in at $1.049 billion. This is lower than the $1.253 billion figure reported in the same quarter in 2018. Here are some key highlights for the quarter: UBS also said it expects to take restructuring expenses of $100 million in the fourth quarter of 2019. UBS, like its peers, is looking at ways to restructure as banks continue to face headwinds from low and negative interest rates. ""Low and persistent negative interest rates and expectations of further monetary easing will adversely affect net interest income compared with last year,"" UBS said in a statement Tuesday. ""As we execute on our strategy, we are balancing investments for growth while managing for efficiency,"" it added. Rising rates are good for banks since they are able to lend out money to investors at a profitable rate of interest. Lower interest rates restrict a bank's ability to make profits thus adding pressure on margins. UBS announced in August that it would introduce a 0.6% annual charge on cash savings of over 500,000 euros ($557,642) and 0.75% on savings of over 2 million Swiss francs ($2.03 million) in order to pass on the cost of negative rates. Speaking to CNBC Tuesday, CEO Sergio Ermotti said: ""The entire industry is faced with the same challenge on negative rates, so we are unfortunately forced to pass some of this pain, so we are not really passing all the pain of negative rates but I think it is inevitable that we will see, probably, the rest of the industry following on that."" UBS continues to face headwinds in its investment banking and global wealth management business. The lender's investment banking unit saw a 59% decline in the third quarter of 2019 in terms of adjusted operating profit before tax. Investment banking is a specific division of banking related to the creation of capital for other companies, governments and other entities. Meanwhile, the bank's global wealth management business saw an 2% decline in adjusted operating profit when compared to the same quarter last year. Addressing the bank's struggles with net interest and recurring fee income, Ermotti said the lender had been able to mitigate lower rates with higher transaction volumes, and was seeking to protect that dynamic. ""When I look at recurring fees, of course there you can see our clients' risk appetite is impacting recurring fees. We see them still buying into mandates but with lower risk profile, therefore with lower margins and in that sense, it was helpful in the third quarter to see the transaction line offsetting some of this,"" he told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche. —CNBC's Elliot Smith contributed to this report.

"More people are going to the mall to eat at the food court, not shop, UBS says","UBS says apparel spending continues to move online, away from bricks-and-mortar stores, with about 25% of total apparel sales in the U.S. taking place on the internet.It expects that to grow to 31% by 2023.","More and more people are going to the mall to eat at the food court, not to buy clothes, according to a survey from UBS. The investment bank said apparel spending continues to move online, away from bricks-and-mortar stores, with about 25% of total apparel sales in the U.S. taking place on the internet today. It expects that to grow to 31% by 2023. ""Shoppers say they increasingly go to the mall to eat at the food court or just hangout instead of visiting a big box store,"" analyst Jay Sole said. ""Since the mall is no longer the place consumers discover fashion, it makes sense the reasons they visit the mall are changing. ... For the sixth straight year, U.S. consumers say the availability of online shopping is causing them to visit large regional and outlet malls less."" UBS expects the shift will hurt department store chains, such as Macy's and J.C. Penney, more than anything else. It said ""disruption"" in the apparel industry will go on for ""at least the next five years."" In its survey of more than 2,500 consumers, UBS said the percentage of people who go to the mall to shop at department stores fell to 20% this year, from 25% a year ago. It said the percentage who go to the mall to eat rose to 7% from 4%. Additionally, Sole explained younger shoppers are leading the changes. UBS said it found people between the ages of 18 and 34 buy more clothes online than older generations. It said apparel shoppers ages 18 to 24, for example, are spending 38% of their apparel budgets online this year, up from 32% in 2014. ""The internet has fundamentally challenged malls' value proposition,"" Sole went on. ""The mall, in the past, was a great aggregator. It was a one-stop-shop where consumers could see everything happening in the world of fashion. Today, the vast majority of fashion discovery happens online. ... Consumers don't need the mall to help them figure out what is cool."" Mall owners are starting to realize this, however. They're not ignorant to the shifting consumer preferences. Some of the biggest mall owners in the U.S., such as Simon Property Group, Taubman and Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield, are investing in new food hall concepts, as they increasingly devote space at their properties to entertainment uses and dining. The new American Dream mall in New Jersey, once it is complete, will be 45% retail shops and the rest of the square footage will be devoted to eateries, theme parks, a ski slope, miniature golf and an ice rink, among other things for visitors to do. Sole said in his Tuesday note that he thinks this particular Triple Five Group development can be a success.",2019-11-05 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/05/people-are-going-to-the-mall-to-eat-at-the-food-court-not-shop-ubs.html?&qsearchterm=,4,455
UBS trader Scott Hapgood skips Anguilla court hearing month after Trump says manslaughter case looks 'very wrong',"UBS trader Scott Hapgood fails to show up for a court hearing in Anguilla, where the Connecticut man is charged with manslaughter in the death of a hotel worker, Kenny Mitchel.President Donald Trump has said that ""something looks and sounds very wrong"" about the case.A spokesman for Hapgood says he ""cannot return to Anguilla to clear his name"" because authorities there ""will not give him a fair trial or guarantee his safety.""","A UBS trader from Connecticut who is charged with manslaughter in the death of a hotel worker in Anguilla failed to return for a court hearing on that British island territory Monday — a month after President Donald Trump said that ""something looks and sounds very wrong"" about the case. A spokesman for the trader, Scott Hapgood, said the 44-year-old Darien resident cannot ""return to Anguilla to clear his name"" because authorities there ""will not give him a fair trial or guarantee his safety."" ""He's not going back,"" the spokesman, Jamie Diaferia, told CNBC. Diaferia said that as Monday's hearing approached, Hapgood's legal team had worked to obtain a guarantee that he would be protected if he returned to Anguilla, and that he would be allowed to return to the United States on bail after the hearing ended. Diaferia said Anguillan authorities declined to give those guarantees and also declined Hapgood's offer to appear at the hearing via a video link with the Caribbean island. The case has sparked outrage on Anguilla, where Hapgood's release on bail was heavily criticized. ""We understand there will be people in Anguilla who say Scott is running from a trial. That is 100% false,"" said Juliya Arbisman, Hapgood's international lawyer. ""There is nothing Scott wants more than to clear his name and get his life back. But he cannot clear his name if he is dead, or if the legal process by which he is bound is fundamentally biased and unjust."" Hapgood, who is on leave from UBS, is charged with killing 27-year-old Kenny Mitchel on April 13 in the Malliouhana Hotel, while two of Hapgood's children were in the room. Hapgood claims that Mitchel, who reportedly was intoxicated by alcohol and cocaine, entered his family's hotel room under the false pretense of having been sent there to fix a broken sink. Mitchel then attacked Hapgood — who was a defensive end on Dartmouth College's football team — with a knife after demanding money, according to Hapgood's account. A struggle ensued, and Mitchel died shortly thereafter. The New York Times has reported that a coroner initially ruled that Mitchel died from asphyxiation. But the same coroner later revised that report after toxicology tests, which suggested that Mitchel ""had so much cocaine in his bloodstream that he was essentially a dying man when he entered Mr. Hapgood's suite that day,"" the Times reported. Hapgood, an account manager with UBS Global Management in New York, is free on a $74,000 bond. Trump first took note of Hapgood on Oct. 14 after the Fox News show ""Fox and Friends"" — a favorite of the president's — aired a segment about the criminal case. ""Will be looking into the Scott Hapgood case, and the Island of Anguilla,"" Trump wrote in a tweet. ""Something looks and sounds very wrong. I know Anguilla will want to see this case be properly and justly resolved."" Twitter The White House had no immediate comment when asked about Hapgood failing to show up for his mandated court appearance on Anguilla. Hapgood's spokesman Diaferia noted in a statement that, ""Despite the unfairness of the charge continuing, Scott has cooperated with the Anguillan legal process and has returned to the island three times for hearings in an effort to clear his name."" ""But it has become progressively apparent that Scott would not receive a fair trial in Anguilla,"" the statement said. ""During the process, a toxicology report was suppressed, witnesses altered their accounts and submitted new statements that were false, a revised cause of death was ignored, legal counsel was excluded from the hearing, and numerous other actions that suggested that politics are governing Scott's case rather than the law and the facts."" The statement said that if authorities revoked Hapgood's bail, ""There is a significant likelihood Scott's incarceration would be indefinite, as a trial may not happen for many years."" And ""there is near certainty the death threats he has received will come to fruition if he were to be held in an Anguillan prison for any length of time,"" the statement said. Hapgood's wife, Kallie Hapgood, told The New York Post last month that she had ""begged him from day one not to go back there"" to Anguilla. ""He knows he did nothing wrong. He's not responsible for Mitchel's death, but to me, I don't know if that is enough to keep him safe. If he were to be remanded to prison, I think it would be the equivalent of a death sentence,"" Kallie Hapgood told The Post.",2019-11-11 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/11/ubs-trader-scott-hapgood-skips-anguilla-hearing-after-trump-comment.html?&qsearchterm=,3,755

China's growth is slowing — but UBS is 'overweight' on Chinese stocks anyway,"Tan Min Lan, UBS head of chief investment office in Asia Pacific, said overall Chinese corporate earnings have done better than expected in the third quarter.She explained that even though growth is slowing in China, the country's economic restructuring is ""actually bearing fruit"" which would benefit some companies. In a 2020 outlook report, UBS said it likes stocks of Chinese internet companies and businesses in the 5G smartphone supply chain.","Economic growth in China is slowing down amid an ongoing trade war with the U.S. — but Swiss wealth management giant UBS is not budging from its ""overweight"" position in Chinese stocks. Chinese gross domestic product grew 6% year-over-year in the third quarter, the weakest pace in at least 27.5 years. UBS forecast that growth in the world's second-largest economy will end this year at 6.1% before slowing even more in the coming years to 5.7% in 2020 and 5.6% in 2021.

She explained that economic restructuring in the last few years has led to consumption contributing a larger share of Chinese growth now, compared with a few years ago. In addition, China has been growing the share of higher value added manufacturing in its economy and consolidated sectors such as upstream materials and property, she said. Those changes have benefited some companies. As a result, earnings of Chinese companies have done better than expected, said Tan.

UBS expects low returns and high volatility for the next decade,"Equity returns are expected to be ""much lower"" than in the last decade, with UBS expecting 4%-6% nominal returns per year in developed markets, in local currency terms.With interest rates remaining broadly low, dollar-denominated high-grade bonds are expected to return around 2.5% a year over the next decade, with euro and Swiss franc (CHF) bonds bringing slightly negative returns.","UBS is predicting a decade of low returns and higher volatility for most financial assets. In a report published Thursday, the Swiss bank set out a vision for 2030 which included working-age populations in developed countries shrinking by 25 million, increasing deglobalization and a ""less favorable political backdrop"" for high-income individuals. The anticipated ""decade of transformation"" will mean ""lower returns and high volatility"" for most assets compared to the past decade, meaning investors targeting a given level of return ""may therefore need to increase their allocation to riskier assets such as equities,"" according to Mark Haefele, CIO of UBS Global Wealth Management. The report projected that with the percentage of wealth in the U.S. owned by the top 0.1% approaching the same as that held by the bottom 90% for the first time since the 1930s, wealth redistribution policies will likely grow in popularity over the next decade. ""Left-leaning parties in countries like the U.S. and the U.K. are proposing increasingly radical prescriptions for addressing income and wealth inequality,"" UBS economists said. Causes of inequality have included lower corporate tax rates, automation, globalized supply chains and the rise of ""capital-light superstar firms."" These are businesses which do not require a great deal of capital to get off the ground, but have the potential to grow at rapid rates, such as web-based start-ups. ""Although voters in the months to come will provide an indication of whether wealth concentration has yet hit its political limits, investors should prepare for some combination of higher taxation, greater regulation, and antitrust measures over the next decade,"" UBS added. The lender also suggested the role of monetary policy will evolve into what Bridgewater Associates' Ray Dalio has called ""monetary policy 3 (MP3)."" Here, fiscal policy assumes a greater role in stimulating economies alongside monetary policy, with the most extreme example being central banks ""handing over printed banknotes directly to consumers and governments,"" the report hypothesized. ""Such policy could result in higher consumption, government spending, and economic growth, or end in inflationary catastrophe."" Equity returns are expected to be ""much lower"" than in the last decade, with UBS expecting 4%-6% nominal returns per year in developed markets, in local currency terms. This is primarily due to modest economic growth, contracting profit margins and ageing populations. However, equities should still return more than most other asset classes, particularly emerging markets, which UBS estimated will return around 9% annually in USD terms thanks to better potential for long term profit growth, though volatility will remain high. With interest rates remaining broadly low, dollar-denominated high-grade bonds are expected to return around 2.5% a year over the next decade, with euro and Swiss franc (CHF) bonds bringing slightly negative returns. Emerging market dollar-denominated sovereign bonds are expected to yield around 4.9% a year. Bond yields in Europe and the U.S. have spent much of 2019 in decline, driven by a wave of easing central bank policies and fears of a global economic downturn.",2019-11-21 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/ubs-expects-low-returns-and-high-volatility-for-the-next-decade.html?&qsearchterm=,6,492
"Impeachment is not a risk for investors — but the 2020 election is, UBS says","Thus far, markets have shown little reaction to developments in the impeachment inquiry, and this could be down to the unlikelihood that the Republican-controlled Senate will convict.The upcoming election in November 2020 could be pivotal, impacting key equity sectors such as technology, energy and health care, UBS strategists projected.","The potential impeachment of U.S. President Donald Trump does not pose a risk to markets, according to UBS. Last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi directed the House Judiciary Committee to draft articles of impeachment against the president following a series of public hearings detailing the administration's conduct regarding foreign policy in Ukraine. Thus far, markets have shown little reaction to developments in the impeachment inquiry, and this could be down to the unlikelihood that the Republican-controlled Senate will convict. ""The UBS U.S. Office of Public Policy regards impeachment as likely, as it can be passed in the House without any Republican votes, but considers a Senate conviction unlikely, as Republicans hold a majority in that chamber and a two-thirds supermajority would be needed,"" UBS Global Wealth Management CIO Mark Haefele said in a note to investors on Monday. Senate Republicans have rallied behind the president throughout the inquiry, consistently adapting their defenses in response to each piece of evidence presented by senior officials and diplomats in sworn testimonies before the House Intelligence Committee. As a result, UBS does not regard uncertainty around the process as a source of market risk. However, the upcoming election in November 2020 could be pivotal, impacting key equity sectors such as technology, energy and health care, the Swiss lender projected. Trump has previously suggested that tech giants could face scrutiny from antitrust regulators, and a Department of Justice review is underway. There is a polarization of views within the Democratic contenders, with frontrunner Joe Biden urging further investigation before action is taken while Senator Elizabeth Warren has published a plan to break up ""big tech."" The Trump administration has loosened environmental regulations on energy companies, but this trend would almost certainly be reversed under any potential Democratic president. Warren has gone as far as to propose an out-and-out ban on fracking by executive order. On the health care front, Trump has set out to weaken the Affordable Care Act (ACA) which is still favored by the Democratic field, albeit with varying views on the extent to which greater provision of public health care is required. There is also a broad consensus among the hopefuls that a form of restriction on drug pricing is necessary, a position which enjoys some bipartisan support and could hurt the health care and pharmaceutical industries. ""So, while the U.S. is one of our preferred markets, specific sectors could face volatility — or even longer-term headwinds — as the election campaign progresses,"" Haefele added. ""Diversification can help reduce these risks, alongside sector-specific strategies if certain threats mount.""",2019-12-09 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/09/ubs-impeachment-is-not-a-risk-for-investors-but-the-2020-election-is.html?&qsearchterm=,4,426

"UBS predicts a 'V-shaped' year where stocks drop, then recover back to where they are now","U.S. equity strategist Francois Trahan raised his 2020 target on the S&P 500 to 3,250 from 3,000, seeing a big sell-off in the first half of year and recover fully in the second half.The UBS analyst expects the benchmark to drop as much as 16% by May when leading economic indicators bottom, based on the market's historical performance.The market will stage a big comeback in the second half of the year as the benefit of lower interest rates filters through the economy, Tranhan predicted.The stocks most attractive to UBS during such an economic transition include Kohl's, Morgan Stanley, Delta Air Lines and HP.","One of the biggest market bears on Wall Street has become less pessimistic, now expecting a volatile year where the S&P 500 takes a round trip. Francois Trahan, head of U.S. equity strategy for UBS, raised his 2020 target on the S&P 500 to 3,250 from 3,000, seeing the market decline in the first half of the year amid an earnings slowdown and recover fully in the second half on economic optimism. The benchmark now trades at about 3,240. ""We expect a V-shaped year for the S&P 500,"" Tranhan said in a note on Tuesday. ""We see the Index struggling in H1'20, as forward earnings come under pressure, and rebounding vigorously in H2'20, as equities start to discount an upcoming recovery in the economy."" Tranhan's new target still puts him below top Wall Street strategists' average forecast of 3,330 for the S&P 500 in 2020, according to CNBC's Market Strategist Survey. The UBS analyst expects the benchmark to drop as much as 16% by May when leading economic indicators such as the ISM manufacturing data bottom, based on the market's historical performance. Also, a decline in earnings expectations will pose a big threat to the market in the near term, Tranhan said. ""Leading indicators of S&P 500 forward earnings argue that they will continue to slow for several more quarters. This is the biggest risk the S&P 500 faces in the near term,"" Tranhan said. The market will stage a big comeback in the second half of the year as the benefit of lower interest rates filters through the economy, Tranhan predicted. ""It is not a secret that lower rates start the clock ticking to an eventual recovery in the economy. What is sometimes a surprise, however, is the 24-month lead time between a change in rates and its eventual impact on U.S. GDP,"" he said. The Federal Reserve cut rates three straight times in 2019 beginning in July from a peak in rates in December 2018, so the market's rebound could begin in the fourth quarter this year after a big sell-off, according to Tranhan. The analyst didn't mention the presidential election in November 2020 in his prediction. Many strategists listed the event as a major risk to the market. Investors will experience increased volatility in 2020 as the economy goes through transition periods, and it's a good time to focus on stocks uncorrelated to the business cycle, Tranhan said. UBS screened stocks with three market-neutral factors — high buyback yield, high long-term growth and high asset turnover. The stocks most attractive to UBS include Kohl's, Morgan Stanley, Delta Air Lines, Qorvo and HP. ""Like all quantitative screens, it is meant to be used in conjunction with fundamental research,"" Tranhan said. ""There is no risk-free strategy unfortunately, as moving fully into a risk-on or risk-off portfolio inevitably leads to very different results.""",2020-01-07 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/07/ubs-predicts-a-v-shaped-year-where-markets-drop-then-recover.html?&qsearchterm=,4,473

An internal memo sent to employees on Tuesday by wealth management bosses Iqbal Khan and Tom Naratil set out plans to divide the Swiss lender's private banking operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa (EMEA) into three parts: Europe (EU), Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) and the Middle East and Africa (MEA). In a conference call Tuesday morning, Khan told journalists that the restructure would involve erasing three levels of management and up to 500 jobs, according to multiple media outlets. The memo sets out plans to improve speed to market and time spent with clients, through ""streamlining"" of processes. ""To deliver on these opportunities we are pleased to announce that we will accelerate decision-making and time to market by delayering, reducing organizational duplication, and increasing business unit (BU) autonomy, which comes with more accountability,"" Khan and Naratil said in the memo.

"The Fed could cut interest rates 3 times this year, UBS predicts","The U.S. Federal Reserve could lower interest rates three times in 2020, Swiss wealth giant UBS predicted.Arend Kapteyn, global head of economic research at UBS, said tariffs implemented in the U.S.-China trade war is expected to drag down U.S. growth to just 0.5% year-on-year in the first half of 2020.Still, he stressed that the impact from tariffs could just be temporary and that the U.S. is not headed into a recession.","Swiss wealth giant UBS has predicted that the U.S. Federal Reserve could lower interest rates three times in 2020 — a forecast that differs widely from many other projections calling for no change or just one rate cut this year. Arend Kapteyn, global head of economic research at UBS, said on Tuesday that tariffs implemented in the trade war between Washington and Beijing would drag down U.S. growth to just 0.5% year-on-year in the first half of 2020. The U.S. last raised tariffs on Chinese goods in September, with China following up with its own duty increase on a variety of American products. Further tariff hikes initially scheduled for December were put off as both sides agreed to hammer out the so-called phase one trade deal. ""We think this tariff damage is going to push U.S. growth down ... that's actually going to trigger three Fed cuts, which is way off consensus, nobody believes that,"" he told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" from the UBS Greater China Conference in Shanghai. The CME FedWatch tool places the probability of the Fed standing pat on interest rates at more than 50% through September. For the central bank's meetings in November and December, that probability falls to 47% and and 40.5%. The tool is based on futures pricing from live markets and reflects the views of traders placing real bets on the CME exchange. Kapteyn noted that Fed officials themselves have shown little inclination to make any moves, with meeting minutes indicating that they're at ""a comfortable hold"" and would want to see ""a material downshift in the data"" before reassessing their position. ""We think they're going to get that downshift. I think you need quite a bit of additional evidence though before they get there. So, we're thinking first cut maybe in March but we really need to see ... loss of growth momentum,"" he said. Still, Kapteyn stressed that the impact from tariffs could just be temporary and that the U.S. is not headed into a recession. ""Even though we have this big slowdown and these cuts, we don't think you get to recession level,"" he said. ""So basically temporary disruption, you get past them pretty quickly and then everything is back to trend."" — CNBC's Yun Li contributed to this report.",2020-01-14 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/14/fed-could-cut-rates-3-times-as-tariffs-drag-down-us-growth-ubs.html?&qsearchterm=,3,380
"Personalized nutrition could be the next plant-based meat, worth $64 billion by 2040, says UBS","Personalized nutrition could generate annual revenues as high as $64 billion by 2040, according to UBS.Big name companies such as Apple, Uber and Amazon could benefit from the massive growth opportunity.""Health data in Apple Watch could be combined with genetic information to offer personalized nutrition,"" UBS analyst Charles Eden said in a note to clients.","Imagine receiving customized nutrition advice based on your personal biologic or genetic profile. That's the ""future of food,"" according to a UBS analyst, who sees diet personalization as the next plant-based meat. Personalized nutrition could generate annual revenues as high as $64 billion by 2040, the firm said. Plus, big-name companies such as Apple, Uber and Amazon could benefit from the massive growth opportunity. ""With heightened health awareness among consumers, yet also more people suffering from ailments which are attributable to poor nutrition, there is growing demand for solutions that can improve individual nutritional choices,"" said UBS analyst Charles Eden in a note to clients on Tuesday. ""Personalised nutrition ... represents a potential such solution."" Personalization is a theme that has swept many industries in recent years. An increasing number of businesses are sending out questionnaires to customers to create profiles for their likes, dislikes and needs. Customized weight loss programs, clothing and shopping companies, makeup brands, vitamin providers, are just a few to have delved into an industry with massive growth potential, said Eden. UBS's theory is that food, medical diagnosis, technology and food delivery companies can all benefit from this industry. From services as simple as questionnaires, blood samples and genetic profiling, companies can capitalize on society's shift in support to improved nutritional habits. UBS said it sees four major industries capitalizing on this opportunity: Medical diagnosis firms to extract and interpret test results; Technology companies to develop wearable tech and integrated platforms for users to receive ongoing interactive feedback; Food producers to meet nutritional demand; And, food delivery companies to meet consumers' increasing demand for convenience. Illumina, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Apple, FitBit, Nestle, 23andMe, Ancestry.com, Unilever, Amazon Fresh and Uber Eats are some of the companies UBS mentioned as being in the game. The personalized nutrition opportunity has not been lost on current food company incumbents. ""Nestlé, the world's largest food company, has identified personalised nutrition as a major growth opportunity and has made a number of investments in the space,"" said Eden. Nestle puts money into research from brain health, pediatrics, chronic medical conditions, obesity, malnutrition, and gastro-intestinal health. Companies like Apple have bet big on personalized health, which could make the Tim Cook-led tech giant a potential pioneer in the personalized nutrition industry. Apple has identified the health care industry as an area of innovation, with its popular Apple Watch providing real-time personal health data to its wearers. ""The Apple Watch is already being used to study heart rates, perform ECGs, study eating disorders, track fitness and many other health metrics. Health data in Apple Watch could be combined with genetic information to offer personalized nutrition,"" said Eden. Even Amazon Fresh, the e-commerce giant's grocery delivery service, and Uber Eats are well-positioned to win in this budding industry, said UBS. ""Delivery will allow for increased convenience and time savings in food preparation (e.g. partnering with Delivery Hero or Uber Eats to deliver the exact meal which has been freshly prepared to meet the needs of that individual consumer),"" said Eden. Eden said affordability is the most obvious constraint on the personalized nutrition scenario in the near term. Healthier foods can be more expensive than mass produced box items, and the personalization will also come with a cost. Scientific evidence on the merits of personalizaiton are also lacking, UBS said. Data privacy is a hurdle as well if consumers don't want their medical, biological or genetic information shared with other parties. — with reporting from CNBC's Michael Bloom.",2020-01-19 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/19/personalized-nutrition-could-be-the-next-plant-based-meat-worth-64-billion-by-2040-says-ubs.html?&qsearchterm=,7,582
"Investors pulled nearly $100 billion from hedge funds in 2019, but UBS insists popularity isn't waning","Data from U.S. research platform eVestment revealed that outflows in December alone hit $16 billion.UBS analysts attributed the flow trends not to the popularity of hedge funds waning, but rather to investors' more advanced understanding of how certain strategies can deliver their desired risk and return profile.","Investors withdrew a net $98 billion from hedge funds in 2019, the largest outflows in three years, but UBS analysts have argued that this does not indicate waning popularity. Data from U.S. research platform eVestment revealed that outflows in December alone hit $16 billion, while Bloomberg reported that investors last year directed 25% of their alternative investments, those outside of traditional areas such as cash, bonds and stocks, into private equity, up from 18% in 2018. However, in a note Monday, UBS Global Chief Investment Officer Mark Haefele suggested that outflows from hedge funds only tell half of the story, as total assets under management are actually rising. ""While some investors may have reduced allocations to the asset class overall, hedge fund assets continued to rise amid strong returns, hitting a record high at $3.3 trillion according to the Hedge Fund Research database (HFR),"" he said, adding that hedge funds in 2019 returned on average 10.4%, their best year for a decade. Haefele suggested that while the industry is seeing redemptions, ""top-tier"" managers are continuing to attract capital, or at least suffer fewer redemptions, with only $8 billion outflows registered in total across managers with AUM over $5 billion compared to $32 billion for managers of between $1 billion and $5 billion AUM. ""Redemptions are largely concentrated in just a few strategies, in particular fundamental value equity hedge managers and multi-strategy macro funds,"" Haefele said. ""This is potentially a reflection of investors' emphasis on more specialized strategies and the search for a better diversifier with a multi-asset portfolio."" UBS analysts attributed the flow trends not to the popularity of hedge funds waning, but rather to investors' more advanced understanding of how certain strategies can deliver their desired risk and return profile. Haefele anticipated that top managers will likely continue to manage a larger share of assets while underperformers will continue to suffer greater outflows. ""Within the asset class, we continue to recommend low directional managers. These can include: relative value managers, such as those who exploit various arbitrage opportunities; discretionary macro funds that can, for instance, capture carry and exploit shifts in economic policy; and multi-strategy managers,"" Haefele concluded.",2020-01-27 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/01/27/ubs-nearly-100-billion-pulled-from-hedge-funds-but-popularity-isnt-waning.html?&qsearchterm=,3,359

Investors are standing by to withdraw some $7 billion from the UBS Trumbull Property Fund as a growing number move away from more cautious funds, a person familiar with the matter told the Wall Street Journal. Hoping to stem the flow, UBS has reportedly offered to cut costs for investors willing to stay in the fund and to forego management fees for new investments, the Journal added citing an analyst presentation to the City of Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Swiss bank's Trumbull fund owns real estate in Cambridge, including the CambridgeSide mall as well as properties across the country in New York, Chicago, Los Angeles and San Francisco. UBS did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. An isolated uptick in redemption requests can lead to a host of issues for investment funds like Trumbull if other investors grow nervous the peer withdrawals and, as a result, choose to join the exodus. If real estate fund managers don't have enough cash on hand to meet a small number of redemption requests, they may be forced to initiate the sale of properties. The sale of such illiquid assets can take time and add to investor angst in the meanwhile, placing even more pressure on the manager to sell property. But in contrast to riskier private-equity funds, which dictate when investors are allowed to extract money and include early-exit penalties, the majority of big core funds aren't as strict about how often or how much its clients are allowed to redeem. And while Trumbull isn't the only big-bank property fund seeing outflows, its underperformance versus industry benchmarks has hastened the investor flight. It had performed worse than the NCREIF NFI-ODCE index on a 1-year, 3-year and 5-year basis as of a 2018 presentation to the City of Naples, Florida, Police and Fire Pension Plans. — Read the original Wall Street Journal report here.",2020-02-11 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/02/11/ubs-reportedly-racing-to-curb-outflows-at-landmark-real-estate-fund.html?&qsearchterm=,4,334

It was his first visit since the outbreak started.Since being first reported in China, the coronavirus has spread across the globe, infecting nearly 114,000 people globally and taking at least 4,000 lives, according to the latest data from the World Health Organization.","As governments around the world scramble to contain the spread of the coronavirus, the situation in China may have ""passed its worst,"" according to the regional chief investment officer of UBS Global Wealth Management's Kelvin Tay. There is a ""semblance that production capability is actually now coming back to the Chinese economy,"" Tay said, citing a decline in the number of reported infections in the country. That will likely make the Chinese economy ""the first in the world"" to get back on track, he told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" on Tuesday. Tay's comments came ahead of Chinese President Xi Jinping's visit to Wuhan on Tuesday, the city where the disease was first reported and the worst hit in the country. It was his first visit since the outbreak in December.  ""Xi Jinping's visit of Wuhan is a symbolic move that shows China is recovering from COVID-19,"" Iris Pang, ING's chief economist for Greater China, told CNBC's ""Capital Connection"" on Tuesday. But Pang expressed caution. ""I am quite wary about this because there are more and more imported cases into China and therefore, the spreading of coronavirus from imported cases and also the recovery of workers work in office and also factories, might also create another wave of coronavirus cases in China,"" she said. ""So I am not that optimistic."" Since being first reported in China, the coronavirus has spread across the globe, infecting nearly 114,000 people globally and taking at least 4,000 lives, according to the latest data from the World Health Organization. Recent weeks have seen particularly severe outbreaks in countries such as Italy, one of the euro zone's largest economies, where quarantine has been expanded to the entire country following a surge in infections and deaths. Asked about the danger of China seeing a resurgence in cases due to the diseases being imported from overseas, Tay from UBS said: ""It's actually easier for the Chinese to control that"" as they can control the airports and ports. ""If you have uncontactable tracing or uncontactable spreads amongst the local population, that is probably a lot more difficult to control,"" he said. Commenting on the potential economic impact of the virus' spread elsewhere, Tay said 60% of China's economy is ""basically domestic consumption,"" adding that this will likely serve as a ""buffer"" if production can be brought back up to speed and consumption begins again. In a bid to stem the spread of the disease, the Chinese government locked down cities and quarantined millions of people, as Beijing declared an extended Lunar New Year holiday and temporarily shut down factories and businesses. Recent economic data have started to point to signs that the world's second-largest economy took a hit during that period.

Over in Japan, the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond was a dismal 0.011%, while the 10-year German bund yield sits in negative territory.""The Chinese bond market is the standout bond market in the world today,"" Briscoe said. ","China's bond market is the exception, UBS Asset Management's Hayden Briscoe said, as investors struggle in their hunt for yield. Major central banks around the world have taken drastic steps, like slashing or maintaining record low interest rates, to shore up financial markets reeling from the coronavirus pandemic. The yield on the 10-year China government bond last stood at 2.913% as of Friday afternoon Singapore time. ""You've got one of the highest nominal yields in the world and ... very, very importantly for bond investors, you've got one of the highest real yields in the world,"" Briscoe, head of fixed income for Asia Pacific at UBS, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Friday. Briscoe explained that a top concern for investors right now is offsetting risk assets. He asked, ""With most bond markets close to zero or if not deeply negative in yields, where are you gonna go today?"" In comparison, the yield on the benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note stood at just 0.7019%. Over in Japan, the yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond was a dismal 0.011%, while the 10-year German bund yield sits in negative territory. ""The Chinese bond market, to us, looks like the standout bond market globally today,"" Briscoe said. Asked whether authorities in China have allowed companies to raise money too easily as they seek to spur the economy, Briscoe said: ""This is the same story around the world wherever you go."" ""The U.S. has done exactly the same thing. Europe's doing the same thing,"" he said. ""Every continent around the world is looking to making sure that these corporates can survive, they can open the doors again and then they get the workers back in and then start producing again."" In fact, Briscoe added, the Chinese government has been ""a lot more controlled"" than expected.  ""You will see a buildup in debt here but you won't see anything like what you've seen in Europe or the U.S. It's a lot more balanced,"" he said. Historically, Briscoe said, a ""huge buildup"" would be observed in the shadow banking sector as well as a lot of infrastructure investment spending. ""We half expected that in the early part of this, back in January and February. That would've been the playbook,"" Briscoe said.",2020-06-19 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/19/the-chinese-bond-market-is-a-standout-globally-says-ubs.html?&qsearchterm=,2,376
"The UK is in 'pole position' for market recovery despite gloomy economic outlook, UBS says","U.K. GDP saw its sharpest contraction since 1979 in the first quarter, and the balance-of-trade deficit widened to £21.1 billion ($26.4 billion).U.K. stocks currently trade at a 19% discount to the MSCI World index, versus an average of 7% since 2002, UBS strategists pointed out in a research note Wednesday.S&P Global has cut its forecast for U.K. GDP in 2020 to an 8.1% contraction, warning of a ""perfect storm"" if Britain suffers a second wave of coronavirus infections and fails to negotiate a post-Brexit free trade agreement.","Although the U.K. faces a gloomy economic picture, UBS believes the country's assets are ""heavily undervalued"" and best placed to capitalize on the Covid-19 recovery. U.K. GDP saw its sharpest contraction since 1979 in the first quarter, and the balance-of-trade deficit widened to £21.1 billion ($26.4 billion). However, strategists at the Swiss bank suggested that a promised £5 billion of government infrastructure spending and several key market dynamics place the U.K. in ""pole position"" to outperform. ""We see the UK as benefiting in an upside scenario for the global economic recovery, among other markets, including U.S. mid-caps, German industrials, and consumer brands,"" said Mark Haefele, the chief investment officer of UBS Global Wealth Management. ""In particular, we see sterling as the most notable beneficiary of the vulnerability of the U.S. dollar, which we expect to fall as safe-haven flows reverse and as political uncertainty mounts ahead of the November U.S. presidential election."" U.K. stocks currently trade at a 19% discount to the MSCI World index, versus an average of 7% since 2002, UBS strategists pointed out in a research note Wednesday, suggesting that this implies considerable upside potential over the next 12 months. Net earnings-per-share (EPS) revisions, the balance of upward and downward revisions to analyst forecasts, have been improving on the back of rising oil prices, but stock performance has remained sluggish. EPS refers to a company's net profit divided by the number of common shares it has outstanding. UBS believes that sterling is second only to the Japanese yen among G-10 currencies in terms of undervaluation relative to the dollar, with strategists estimating its purchasing power parity (PPP) with the greenback is 1.54, against a current exchange rate of 1.25. PPP uses the prices of particular goods to compare the absolute purchasing power of currencies in various countries. The note also highlighted that some value stocks (those which trade at a low price relative to their fundamentals) and cyclical sectors (those which generally track economic performance) which have upside potential in the Covid-19 economic recovery align well with the U.K. equity market. In particular, the FTSE 100 has a 40% cumulative exposure to value sectors such as banks, basic materials and energy. ""Notably, the U.K. would benefit from a recovery in the Brent crude oil price, which we expect to rise to USD 55 a barrel by the end of the second quarter of next year,"" UBS strategists said. Energy stocks account for 12% of the FTSE 100 index, compared to just 4% for the MSCI World index. S&P Global on Wednesday cut its forecast for U.K. GDP in 2020 to an 8.1% contraction, warning of a ""perfect storm"" if Britain experiences a second wave of coronavirus infections and fails to negotiate a post-Brexit free trade agreement with the European Union. The U.K. has passed the June 30 deadline to request an extension to the current transition period beyond the end of 2020, meaning its future trading relationship with the bloc will have to be determined over the next six months. Berenberg Chief Economist Holger Schmeiding noted Thursday that despite an extension being off the table, the tone from British and European leaders has softened, with both sides floating possible compromises over governance, level playing field provisions and politically sensitive fisheries. But despite signs of progress, Berenberg does not expect a deal before year-end. ""Instead, we expect the two sides to agree on some modest stopgap measures in order to prevent a disorderly hard exit,"" Schmeiding said. ""Instead of one big cliff edge, where the U.K.-EU economic relationship suddenly shifts from open single market rules to the much more restrictive World Trade Organisation rules for trade, we expect the two sides to see to it that the switch occurs in a series of smaller steps."" S&P Global now assumes that a ""core"" trade agreement will be reached, rather than the comprehensive accord once hoped for by the markets, and suggested that the switch to this regime will dampen the 2021 rebound and drag on growth in the coming years. The ratings agency now expects that the U.K. economy will be around 3% smaller in 2022 than initially projected before the pandemic. Despite the potential headwinds, however, Haefele's UBS team believes the monetary and political risks are ""overdone"" and overstating the concerns that no agreement is reached, owing to a clear incentive for both sides to avoid such an outcome. ""We also believe markets have been exaggerating the risk of the Bank of England reducing rates into negative territory, a potential drag on the pound,"" the UBS note added. The Bank of England revealed last month that it had been assessing the impact of negative rates, but Governor Andrew Bailey confirmed that this was not an immediate consideration, and the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) did not discuss it at June's policy meeting. ""As these risks subside, we expect the pound to regain ground and investment into the U.K. to pick up,"" Haefele concluded.",2020-07-02 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/02/ubs-uk-in-pole-position-for-market-recovery-despite-gloomy-economic-outlook.html?&qsearchterm=,7,825
UBS posts 11% fall in second-quarter profit as it warns of continued credit losses,"In its outlook, the bank warned that continued group credit losses could be expected in the second half of the year due to the coronavirus pandemic, but said these would be below those seen in the first half.Higher trading activity continued to bolster the bank's earnings in the period.But that was unable to offset the pandemic-induced downturn in its retail and corporate banking units.","UBS announced a net profit of $1.23 billion for the second quarter of 2020, down 11% from the same period last year ($1.4 billion) as the coronavirus pandemic weighed on earnings. Analysts polled by the bank had expected a net profit of $973 million for the quarter. The Swiss lender had reported a net profit attributable to shareholders of $1.6 billion for the previous quarter, as financial market volatility enabled the operating profits of the Swiss investment bank to surge. However, it had warned of an uncertain future in the coming quarters as the pandemic began to spread throughout the world, eventually bringing the global economy to a standstill. Higher trading activity continued to bolster the bank's earnings in the period, but was unable to offset the pandemic-induced downturn in its retail and corporate banking units. Here are the highlights from the second-quarter earnings report: The results included credit loss expenses of $272 million, of which $110 million came in personal and corporate banking and $78 million in the investment bank. In its outlook, the bank warned that continued group credit losses could be expected in the second half of the year due to the coronavirus pandemic, but said these would be below those seen in the first half. UBS also said it was reviewing the mix between cash dividends and share buybacks in light of the elevated uncertainty surrounding the Covid-19 pandemic. ""While it is premature to provide guidance for 2020, going forward the intention is to continue to pay out excess capital and maintain the overall capital returns to shareholders consistent with previous levels,"" the bank said in its earnings report, adding that share repurchases may continue in the fourth quarter depending on business development and the second-half outlook. In a statement Tuesday, UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti said: ""As we continue to face a challenging environment, we are adapting and accelerating the pace of change, supporting our clients, employees, and the economies in which we operate, while remaining focused on our strategic priorities."" Ermotti will be replaced at the helm by ING CEO Ralph Hamers on November 1 this year. Ermotti told CNBC on Tuesday morning that the scale and frequency of potential geopolitical, political and economic events in the second half of the year means more clients will be looking to alter their asset allocation before year-end. He pointed to a UBS client survey which revealed that 61% of clients are considering rebalancing their portfolios after the U.S. election on November 3, regardless of the outcome. ""If I put everything together, I do expect the second half of the year maybe not to be as benign as the first half, but still quite robust,"" Ermotti told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe."" He also suggested that there is a degree of either ""complacency"" or ""over-optimism"" in financial markets, with most asset classes now at or around their pre-Covid levels despite a multitude of possible tail risks. ""Credit is still not there but has been coming in a lot, and therefore there is not a lot of room for disappointment in the financial markets,"" Ermotti said. ""In that sense, should the situation deteriorate, I do expect some movements in the market to reflect the new economic data that we will see coming out after the summer.""",2020-07-21 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/07/21/ubs-earnings-q2-2020.html?&qsearchterm=,4,546
UBS reaches 20-year naming rights deal for NHL's Islanders Belmont Park arena,"The New York Islanders' new arena located at Belmont Park will be named UBS Arena after a 20-year naming rights deal with the bank.According to a report, the agreement is worth $350 million.","The New York Islanders' new arena at Belmont Park finally has a name. Switzerland-based investment bank UBS has secured the naming rights to the National Hockey League's newest arena, which will now be called UBS Arena. The agreement is for 20 years, but a UBS Americas official declined to reveal the firm's annual fee for the rights. However, according to Sports Business Journal, which also reported the transaction, the deal is worth $350 million, and pays roughly $17.5 million per year. As part of the deal, UBS, which has its U.S. headquarters in New York City, will have increased brand awareness via exterior signage, a UBS logo placement on the roof and its logo placed on center ice for NHL games. The $1.5 billion complex in Elmont, New York, is located behind the track for the Belmont Stakes and is scheduled to open for the 2021-2022 NHL season. According to the release announcing the deal, UBS Arena and future development projects are expected to ""generate approximately $25 billion in economic activity"" and 3,000 permanent arena jobs for workers who live in the surrounding communities. In a conference call with CNBC discussing the transaction, Islanders owner Jon Ledecky said UBS is making ""a terrific commitment to the overall New York economy with this deal."" ""This is a privately funded arena and resources like a naming rights deal are critical to the success of the project,"" he said, noting the ""$100 million investment in transit and infrastructure enhancements, including the first New York Long Island Railroad station in 50 years."" Despite Covid-19 concerns, Tim Leiweke, CEO of advisory firm Oak View Group, who helped secure financing for the building, said UBS Arena is still projected to host 150 to 200 major events annually. Oak View Group also secured the naming rights for Amazon to take over Climate Pledge Arena, formerly KeyArena, in Seattle. Seattle was awarded an NHL expansion franchise in 2018. The unnamed team will be the NHL's 32nd team and it's projected to start play in the 2021-2022 season. Before the coronavirus suspended NHL games, the Islanders split time between the Barclays Center in Brooklyn and its original Nassau Coliseum home since 1972. The team announced it would be moving back to Nassau County in December 2017 with the construction of the new 18,000-seat arena at Belmont Park ""This anchors one more time the arena at Belmont and the Islanders as a fundamental part of Long Island,"" NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said on the call with CNBC. ""It will be a boom for the Long Island economy.""

Tim Leiweke, the CEO of arena development firm Oak View Group, told CNBC the building will include air cleaning technology in four corners of the arena where giant HVAC systems are located. It plans to spend $2 million and is partnering with ME Engineering on the systems and architecture firm Populous. ""The long-term solution is going to be medicine, treatment, and vaccine,"" added Leiweke. ""But it's also going to be cleaner, smarter air. So, in an indoor space, what we're thinking is – how do we create cleaner, fresher air?"" The tech circulates air and zaps viruses with high-intensity UV lighting, cleaning  the air before its pumped back into breathing spaces. Leiweke said similar systems are used in smaller spaces like locker rooms throughout the National Football League and in hospitals. ""The issue is: How do you get it into an 850,000-square foot arena and make it work? And that's what we're working on,"" Leiweke said. ""These are the sort things our task force – ME Engineering and Populous – are all working on now. How do we get the building of the future that's more driven by health and wellness?""  ""What we haven't figured out is: What does the beast cost, and how do you build it?"" Since the pandemic began, sports teams have researched virus-killing solutions, including air cleaners, as indoor-based leagues hope to attract spectators back for 2020-21 seasons.  The University of Houston created air filters to trap and kill viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, which causes COVID-19. The filter uses a unique heated nickel foam material, which helps destroy viruses. With demand growing due to the pandemic, the HVAC filters market is projected to become a $7.1 billion market by 2025, up from its current $5.5 billion value. The pandemic has delayed construction on the Elmont facility, pushing its scheduled debut in 2021 by two months. UBS Arena is expected to be ready in time for the National Hockey League's 2021-22 season. Leiweke said OVG, which is also developing the Seattle Kraken's home, Climate Pledge Arena, will also look to eliminate numerous ""touchpoints"" throughout buildings. The firm wants to explore items such as antimicrobial door handles and create more ""grab and go"" concepts at concession stands using cashless systems. ""Some of this will be in place when we open up both Seattle and New York,"" Leiweke added. ""The future of these buildings will not be league certified. It'll be sustainability, sanitization, safety-diversity certified. We're spending money now to get ahead of that because that's what people are going to care about in your building.""",2020-10-09 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/09/new-york-islanders-want-virus-killing-air-systems-installed-in-arena.html?&qsearchterm=,2,459

""It is very difficult not to be happy with this set of numbers because they are coming from a great contribution from all business units,"" CEO Sergio Ermotti told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore Tuesday. Analysts had expected the Swiss bank and asset manager to report $1.5 billion of net income for the third quarter, according to data from Refinitiv Eikon. It comes after an 11% drop in profit for the second quarter, as the global banking industry felt the full effect of the coronavirus pandemic. ""We speak a lot about stimulus and Covid-related matters, but the geopolitical uncertainties in Europe, and also in the Sino-U.S. relationship, (are) still there and they're there to stay so we shouldn't underestimate that,"" Ermotti added. UBS said pre-tax profit for the third quarter rose 92% to $2.6 billion, in what it described as its best third-quarter result in a decade. The Swiss lender's results are the first of Europe's banks. Analysts are expecting a better quarter for the sector following a tough first half off the back of the coronavirus outbreak and economic crisis. UBS said loan loss provisions for the period came in at $89 million, significantly lower than the amounts booked in the first and second quarters. It also said it planned to pay its delayed dividend from 2019 in November of this year, and had set aside $1.5 billion for share repurchases which it expects to start next year. Here are other highlights of the third quarter: Pre-tax profit in UBS' investment bank rose 268%, on the back of market volatility in the wake of the coronavirus crisis. While its wealth management division posted an 18% rise in profit before tax, and total invested assets hit an all-time high of $2.75 billion. The bank attributed its results to ongoing strong client activity and the ""benefits of a well-diversified business model with broad regional mix.""

I think what we are doing is staying very agile and staying very focused on our plan."" From a geographical standpoint, Ermotti also said that the U.S. and Asia ""offer bigger and greater growth opportunities"" than Europe, adding that the latter needed to implement more structural reforms and regain competitiveness.

""If countries start to impose 'circuit breaker' lockdowns that last just several weeks, that may already be enough to turn a positive (fourth quarter) growth rate negative,"" he said. The phrase ""circuit breaker"" has become popular in the U.K. and refers to a short but strict lockdown intended to break the chain of infection.

UBS gives 3 reasons for why the Chinese yuan is 'attractive' right now,"UBS Global Wealth Management's Dominic Schnider says ""the stars are really lining up"" for the Chinese yuan to strengthen against the dollar.The Chinese yuan has seen a significant strengthening so far this year, as data releases continue to show the country powering ahead of the rest of its peers globally in recovering from the coronavirus pandemic.","In this article SINGAPORE — The Chinese yuan is set to see further gains in the short term, according to UBS Global Wealth Management's Dominic Schnider. ""The stars are really lining up for a stronger (Chinese yuan),"" Schnider, head of commodities and Asia-Pacific foreign exchange/macro at UBS told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Wednesday. The Chinese currency has strengthened significantly so far this year, and data releases continue to show the country powering ahead of its global peers in its recovery from the coronavirus pandemic. As of Friday morning Singapore time, the onshore Chinese yuan sat at 6.6891 against the greenback, nearly 4% stronger since the start of the year. The Chinese currency's offshore counterpart — which trades more freely than the onshore yuan — traded at 6.689 per dollar. It has also gained almost 4% against the U.S. dollar since the beginning of the year. China's onshore yuan, also known as the renminbi, trades within a narrow band stipulated by the central bank, which steps in to buy or sell the yuan when it deviates outside that range, in order to stem volatility. For its part, UBS Global Wealth Management has a short-term target of 6.6 for the Chinese yuan against the dollar. Schinder said there are three factors that will likely to strengthen the currency: economic growth, balance of payments and inflows. China's economy is growing at a faster pace than its Western peers, he said. China said its gross domestic product grew 4.9% year-on-year in the third quarter of this year, in a sign that the economy was picking up steam again. In comparison, other economies such as the U.S. and countries in Europe are not expecting year-on-year expansion until the first half of 2021. ""The U.S. and Europe are already growing from a quarter-on-quarter perspective, but they are lagging China by a wide margin,"" Schnider told CNBC in a follow-up email. This ""speaks in favor"" of foreign direct investments as well as risk assets in China, such as its stock market, and the yuan. Secondly, China's current account surplus could grow to almost 2.8% of GDP in 2020 compared to 1% of GDP in 2019, the analyst said. ""A growing current account surplus, due to stronger exports and a smaller service balance deficit, tends to favor a stronger currency in the quarters ahead,"" he said. On the subject of inflows, Schnider said there are ""two angles"" to the issue. First, the inclusion of Chinese government bonds in global bond benchmarks is expected to ""trigger"" inflows of between $100 billion and $150 billion over the next 12 to 18 months, he said. Next, China has a ""solid yield carry"" compared to the U.S., he said, referring to a strategy known as carry trade, where investors make a profit on the difference between interest paid and interest earned. This can be achieved by borrowing in a low-yielding currency (such as the U.S. dollar) to fund investments in higher-yielding assets elsewhere. ""Even volatility adjusted, the (yuan) yield carry is attractive,"" the analyst said. With none of the countries in the Group of 10 currently offering a yield that is attractive as China, Schnider said, portfolio inflows into the country are set to remain strong and hence, strengthen the yuan.

"'Don't be under the illusion' that an economic recovery will come quickly with a vaccine, UBS' Weber says","The announcement earlier this week that an effective coronavirus vaccine has been developed was given a rapturous welcome by global markets.UBS Chairman Axel Weber cautioned that even with a vaccine, it will take time for the global economy to get back to pre-crisis levels.It could take a considerable amount of time to mass produce the vaccine and distribute it around the world.","The announcement earlier this week that an effective coronavirus vaccine has been developed was given a rapturous welcome by global markets, but UBS Chairman Axel Weber cautioned that even with a vaccine, it will take time for the global economy to get back to pre-crisis levels. ""Going forward, I'm not pessimistic. I mean, eventually we'll get through this. But we should not be under the illusion that it will happen fast, it will take some time,"" Weber told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche Tuesday. ""It would be at least a year to go back to pre-crisis levels of GDP (gross domestic product). It'll take another year or two to be anywhere near getting unemployment and pre-crisis growth back and so it would be quite a long recovery that we're facing,"" he said as UBS holds a virtual European conference this week. Hopes that life, and the economy, could get back to normal sooner rather than later got a huge boost on Monday when U.S. pharmaceutical giant Pfizer and German firm BioNTech announced that their coronavirus vaccine was more than 90% effective in preventing Covid-19. Pfizer's CEO and Chairman Dr. Albert Bourla hailed the development as ""a great day for science and humanity"" and stock markets around the world soared. The optimism around the announcement was tempered with a dose of reality given the likely difficult logistics of mass production and transportation of a vaccine, particularly when time is of the essence in terms of saving lives and livelihoods.    The Pfizer vaccine requires two doses per person and based on current projections, only 25 million people could be vaccinated by the end of the year; Pfizer and BioNTech said they expect to produce up to 50 million vaccine doses in 2020, and up to 1.3 billion doses in 2021.  The world population is estimated to be around 7.5 billion and there could be wranglings over which countries receive the vaccine first, although governments in Europe, the U.K. and the U.S. have already bought millions of doses. Asked about his reaction to the vaccine, Weber said while ""it was definitely good news,"" it would take time to roll out vaccination programs at a domestic and global level. The expectation is that Covid-19 vaccines will be given to those in health and service occupations first, as well as the most vulnerable members of society, before it's rolled out to the rest of the population. ""We've been waiting for some good news for some time now ... And the latest news has been really taken well by the market. But you know, you have to take this with a grain of salt,"" Weber cautioned. ""The disappointing part of the news was that the much lower than expected number of vaccinations that can be produced in a year, and if you look at the rollout, that will happen, it's going to take some time, 'til we move to roll this out."" Asked what the vaccine means for the Swiss lender's forecast for 2021, Weber was cautiously optimistic. ""You know, if dispensing that way ... actually has an impact on economic activity, it will eliminate some tail risks, and some of the human suffering will be much improved as a result of it. But it's a long haul (before) we get anything that is close to what people call mass immunity,"" he said.",2020-11-11 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/11/coronavirus-vaccine-doesnt-mean-a-quick-economic-recovery-ubs-weber.html?&qsearchterm=,2,555

The announcement fueled optimism that the pandemic could come to an end sooner rather than later, driving up stock markets globally. UBS had originally estimated that the number of coronavirus infections in the U.S. would approach zero by the end of 2021, but the vaccine news has made the bank bring that forecast forward by six months. ""We might get a situation where reported cases of Covid in the United States fall very close to zero in Q2 (second quarter) of next year. That six month difference, that two-quarter difference matters a lot, it means an extra 1 to 1.25 percentage point gain in GDP next year,"" Seth Carpenter, chief U.S. economist at UBS, told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche on Thursday. He added that the vaccine news ""was very encouraging"" because the efficacy rate came in much higher than analysts were anticipating. The United States has experienced more than 10 million Covid-19 cases since the pandemic started. The country has seen record highs this week in terms of coronavirus hospitalizations and daily infections, with 153,496 cases on Thursday, according to Johns Hopkins University. This comes as speculation mounts on whether the U.S. economy will be shut down once again. An advisor to President-elect Joe Biden has said that closing businesses for four to six weeks could help reduce the number of infections and get the economy on track until a vaccine is approved and distributed. With cases surging in Chicago, Mayor Lori Lightfoot asked residents on Thursday to cancel Thanksgiving plans and stay indoors. Carpenter's comments differ to the caution portrayed by experts such as White House coronavirus advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci. He warned on Thursday that a vaccine may not be enough to help eradicate the disease. ""I doubt we are going to eradicate this. I think we need to plan that this is something we may need to maintain control over chronically. It may be something that becomes endemic, that we have to just be careful about,"" he said. The performance of the U.S. economy in 2021 will also depend on how much fiscal stimulus is approved. Talks between Democrats and Republicans have not yielded a deal, and there's more uncertainty in the aftermath of the presidential election. Carpenter believes U.S. policymakers will disappoint markets by providing a lower-than-expected support package. ""We are actually a little bit pessimistic here relative to where the market is, so we have written down about a $450 billion package that comes in Q1 (first quarter) next year,"" he said. In speaking with clients, he said markets are expecting $1 trillion in fiscal stimulus. UBS assumes that Republicans will retain control of the Senate. If the Senate were to be led by  Democrats, the bank believes the stimulus could be near $1 trillion.

""We are looking for a strong earnings recovery across all major regions of the world,"" said Tan Min Lan, Asia Pacific head of chief investment office at UBS Global Wealth Management. ""In Asia itself, earnings actually were remarkably resilient in 2020, actually it fell by 1% versus the global earnings which declined between 25% to about 30% in some of the key regions.""

Markets have ""obviously paid forward for that"" with their very strong performance last year, Moe added. ""But even with valuations at this extended level, as long as interest rates stay low, we think that markets can roughly hold on to their current valuation and ride the underlying earnings recovery up — which we think is going to result in some further attractive gains for markets this year, albeit … not quite as strong as we had last year,"" Moe said. The hunt for yield will continue amid a low interest rate environment, Tan from UBS said, adding that investors can look for investment returns in a couple of ways. They can take on more credit risk, for instance, by investing in emerging market bonds and sovereign U.S.-dollar Asian high-yield bonds, she said.  ""Secondly, is to look for dividend yielding stocks, because as the economy recovers, the ... economically sensitive stocks, I think their dividend payment capacity is going to be restored,"" she said. ""There are good quality companies in the financial space, in the energy space that still provide reasonable dividends.""  Tan also addressed the impact of U.S. regulatory actions on Chinese stocks. The New York Stock Exchange is set to delist three Chinese telecommunications giants after going back and forth on that decision.  The exchange first announced on Dec. 31 that U.S.-traded shares of China Telecom, China Mobile and China Unicom will be removed from the Big Board as soon as Jan. 7. It cited compliance to President Donald Trump's executive order banning investments in companies with alleged ties to China's military.  But on Tuesday, the stock exchange reversed its decision and halted the process, before making another U-turn overnight to delist the firms after all. However it plays out, Tan said that any impact on the Chinese stocks won't be too significant. ""The situation will remain fluid, and we don't really know what Joe Biden ... will do 15 days later from here,"" she said, referring to the president-elect who will be inaugurated on Jan. 20. ""But suffice to say that if we look at all the stocks impacted by the executive order, it amounts to about 5% of the MSCI China index — delisting per se is not going to have that much of an impact on these stocks,"" she added. On Tuesday, Trump signed another executive order banning transactions with eight Chinese software applications. It included digital payment platforms WeChat Pay by Tencent Holdings, and Ant Group's Alipay.

What investors are watching for as UBS prepares to kick off Europe's bank earnings,"Barclays European banking analysts said market focus in the upcoming reporting season would be on lenders' plans to mitigate the continued effects of the pandemic, including cost actions to offset revenue pressure, along with the resumption of capital distribution and asset quality risks.UBS will kickstart the earnings season for Europe's major lenders on Jan. 26, having posted a 99% rise in net profit in the third quarter of 2020.","LONDON — With European lenders set to begin reporting fourth-quarter and full-year earnings next week, analysts are expecting a resilient performance led by strong investment banking revenues. Banking stocks have made a significant comeback of late, with the pan-European Stoxx 600 banking index up around 40% since the lows registered at the start of the fourth quarter of 2020. The resurgence has been driven primarily by positive news on Covid-19 vaccines and an easing of restrictions on dividends and share buybacks from regulators. A spike in trading and investment banking revenues helped lenders around the world to report solid earnings in the third quarter of 2020, benefiting from increased trading volumes and market volatility since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. Earnings this week from the Wall Street banks have indicated that the sector could be set for a strong season, with Morgan Stanley beating expectations on Wednesday with a 51% increase in net profit for the fourth quarter. Goldman Sachs and JPMorgan had already posted earnings beats on the back of robust trading and investment banking results. In a note Wednesday, Barclays European banking analysts said market focus in the upcoming reporting season would be on lenders' plans to mitigate the continued effects of the pandemic, including cost actions to offset revenue pressure, along with the resumption of capital distribution and asset quality risks. While many banks have avoided announcing full-year guidance due to the uncertainty of the pandemic, Barclays Co-Head of European Banks Equity Research Amit Goel expects full-year guidance for 2021 to be announced in this cycle. UBS will kickstart the earnings season for Europe's major lenders on Jan. 26, having posted a 99% rise in net profit in the third quarter of 2020. Barclays analysts updated its estimates last week and now expect profit-before-tax increases of around 2.5%, 6.4% and 13.9% in 2022 for Credit Suisse, UBS and Deutsche Bank, respectively. Fourth-quarter revenues are expected to remain relatively subdued, albeit varied in terms of geography based on the pace of economic recovery in the fourth quarter, while retaining the bright spots in trading and investment banking. ""While the low interest rate environment continues to pressure bank profitability, we see some bright spots, such as the buoyant post-lockdown U.K. mortgage market,"" Goel said. Barclays expects trading revenues to remain elevated with several banks already providing guidance for the fourth quarter, and forecasts revenues up 18% from the same period in 2019, in U.S. dollar terms. Total revenues for the first nine months of 2020 were down by around 5% on aggregate across a sample of banks analyzed by DBRS Morningstar, largely weighed down by lockdowns in the second quarter of 2020 along with lower net interest income and ""other income."" DBRS Morningstar expects GDP growth to be positive across Europe in 2021, but analysts suggested that the still difficult environment may lead banks to tighten lending criteria and therefore limit revenues. ""Growth in lending to corporates could continue to be supported by government financing schemes and guarantees in the short-term, partly offsetting the negative impact of lockdowns,"" they said in a recent note. ""However, amid ultra-low rates, potentially higher funding costs, and other income such as net fees and commissions being penalised by lockdowns, the pressure on revenues is likely to continue."" An improvement in consensus macroeconomic expectations in most geographies since the third quarter of 2020 is expected to provide a supportive backdrop for banks, according to Barclays analysts, particularly with regard to cash set aside for expected loan losses. ""Our analysis suggests that the improvement in macroeconomic assumptions could result in loan loss provision write-backs,"" Goel said in the note. ""However, we believe that management teams are likely to take a conservative approach at 4Q20 given ongoing risks associated with new lockdowns, and instead we expect most banks to top-up their loan loss provisions."" While state guarantees mitigated the expected increase in non-performing loans in 2020, the unwinding of these measures and renewed lockdowns in a number of economies mean non-payments and a deterioration of banks' asset quality are likely to rise in 2021, DBRS Morningstar anticipates. ""The impact of the pandemic on European banks' asset quality and cost of risk in 2021 will depend on the length of economic restrictions and overall economic impact as well as on any additional support measures to prevent a major deterioration in borrowers' payment capacity."" In December, the European Central Bank and the U.K.'s Prudential Regulation Authority, along with other regulators, lifted bans on banks paying dividends to shareholders or repurchasing their own shares, albeit with guardrails in place. Euro zone banks regulated by the ECB are under tighter restrictions than those in the U.K. and Sweden. The ECB requested European banks refrain from or limit dividends until Sept. 30, and capped dividends below 15% of cumulated 2019-2020 net earnings. As a result, Barclays forecast an average dividend yield of around 1.5% for lenders in the common currency bloc compared to around 5% in Sweden and 2% in the U.K. ""With the restart of dividends, we think there will be increasing focus on the potential for highly accretive share buybacks (though we think these are most likely from 2H21),"" Goel said. Companies may buy back their own shares from the market when they have cash at hand, which usually boosts their stock price. DBRS analysts expect banks to maintain solid capital cushions, but noted that while the ECB guidelines reflect generally high solvency positions for European banks, the differing measures taken by regulators outside the euro zone may pose a challenge. ""Some non-Eurozone banks will likely have flexibility to pay larger dividends. Bans on dividends were widely introduced by global regulators in 2020, but regulators in countries including the U.K., Sweden, Norway for instance have lifted their dividend bans and introduced a cap of 25% instead,"" they said.",2021-01-22 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/22/analysts-key-themes-as-european-bank-earnings-season-begins-with-ubs-.html?&qsearchterm=,2,970

Analysts had expected income to come in at $967 million for the three-month period, according to Refinitiv. It comes after the Swiss bank reported net income of $2.1 billion for the third quarter of last year. Double-digit profit growth in UBS' wealth management and asset management divisions contributed to the quarterly performance. The bank also revealed that it would restart buying back its shares. It announced a new three-year program in which it plans to purchase up to 4 billion Swiss francs ($4.5 billion) of shares, $1 billion of which will be purchased during the first quarter of 2021. Buybacks offer a way for firms to return cash to shareholders — along with dividends — and usually coincide with a company's stock pushing higher as shares get scarcer. At a time when banks have been discouraged from paying dividends, UBS also announced it will propose a 2020 dividend of $0.37 per share. The results are the first under the leadership of Ralph Hamers, who took over as the new chief executive officer on Nov. 1. Speaking to CNBC on Tuesday, Hamers highlighted a ""record number in invested assets of more than 1 trillion (dollars) in the asset manager and more than 3 trillion (dollars) in the wealth manager."" ""And basically that shows you the success of UBS, which is (a) very strong asset manager, very strong wealth manager, (and) if the markets are repositioning, you see that Investment Banking does really well,"" he told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche. Despite beating analyst expectations with its results, UBS was cautious on the economic outlook. ""On the one side clearly there is some light at the end of the tunnel with the vaccination programs,"" Hamers said. But he added: ""On the other side we are in heavy lockdowns, certainly also here in Europe, so you don't know what the real impact on the economy is and how the economy will actually get out of this pandemic."" The start of 2021 has been clouded by tighter social restrictions, mainly in Europe, where governments have also been criticized for a slow roll out of Covid-19 vaccines. There are also concerns over new variants of coronavirus which are more transmissible and leading to higher infections levels.

"UBS says stocks have 5% to 10% further to run, but watch out for this yield level","In a monthly investment call Tuesday, U.K. CIO Caroline Simmons said analysts had a particular preference for emerging markets in Asia and China in particular.She also backed cyclical and value stocks — those whose performance will coincide with economic recovery or those with valuations lower than their financial position would justify.","UBS Global Wealth Management sees 5% to 10% upside for global stock markets, with emerging markets, financials, energy stocks and small caps best placed to capitalize. In a monthly investment call Tuesday, U.K. CIO Caroline Simmons said analysts had a particular preference for emerging markets in Asia and China in particular. She also backed cyclical and value stocks — those whose performance will coincide with economic recovery or those with valuations lower than their financial position would justify. This is based on expectations that the economic recovery will broaden out and accelerate over the course of the year, continuing to support a rotation from the high-flying growth sectors such as technology into sectors that benefit from an acceleration of industrial production and rising inflation. ""Small caps tend to be more cyclical in terms of their sector makeup than larger caps, so they are more convergent to the economic recovery, and their valuations remain attractive,"" Simmons said on the call. ""The price-to-book ratio of the MSCI Small Cap (index) relative to the MSCI World is nearly two standard deviations below the long run average, so the small caps, despite having already performed quite strongly since November, remain attractively priced."" She noted that financials had underperformed the S&P 500 by around 5% since the end of 2019, but have recently begun to make a comeback as the rotation to value and inflation expectations gathered pace. A recent rise in the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield and other bond yields around the world have triggered volatility in equity markets, as investors began to question the valuations of growth-based sectors susceptible to higher interest rates. The 10-year yield was hovering at around 1.6209% on Thursday morning in Europe, but UBS forecasts that it will reach around 2% by the end of the year. ""Higher yields and steeper yield curves generally are more helpful for financials. They help their net interest margins and they also generally see an improvement in non-performing loans,"" Simmons said. She added that financial earnings would benefit if provisions for bad loans are seen to be excessive compared to the reality of the loan losses, while valuations remain low relative to the rest of the market. Meanwhile energy stocks, as of Tuesday afternoon's call, had unperformed the S&P 500 by around 33% since the end of 2019, and UBS believes there is considerable room for a catchup. The Swiss lender forecasts Brent crude prices to hit $75 per barrel by the end of the year, and Simmons noted that energy companies are offering strong cash flows and dividend yields. International benchmark Brent crude futures traded at $63.60 on Thursday morning. While rising bond yields have caused some jitters in the market, Simmons argued that a continued climb would not necessarily spell the end for equity gains. ""In the past 25 years, there have been 10 periods in which the 10-year Treasury yield rose by more than 100 basis points, and in all of those instances, global equities delivered flat or positive returns,"" she pointed out. In a letter to investors Monday, UBS Global Wealth Management CIO Mark Haefele noted that rising inflation expectations also tend to reduce equity risk premiums, though he added that ""all else equal, higher yields do present a headwind for stock valuations. Haefele highlighted that despite rising yields, current valuations are above the long-term average for the equity risk premium. An equity risk premium is the return generated on a particular asset over and above the risk-free rate of return. ""We don't think that inflation or yields are a risk. What I will say is that if you get yields moving significantly higher, maybe above 2.25% on the U.S., then that does potentially start to have implications for the valuations of the equities, and then it would become a discussion about whether the earnings growth is strong enough to offset a valuation impact or not,"" Simmons said.",2021-03-25 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/25/ubs-says-stocks-have-5percent-to-10percent-further-to-run-but-watch-out-for-this-yield-level.html?&qsearchterm=,4,650

At the end of last year, there were 115,000 shopping centers — a figure that includes strip centers, malls, outlet and other lifestyle centers — across the U.S., compared with 112,000 in 2010 and 90,000 in 2000, UBS found in an analysis using data from the International Council of Shopping Centers. That equates to about 59 square feet of shopping center space per U.S. household, which is slightly less than 62 square feet in 2010, UBS said. But it's still well above the 55 square feet of space per household in 2000, and 49 square feet in 1990, analysts Michael Lasser and Jay Sole explained. UBS is estimating that about 80,000 retail stores, which is 9% of total stores, will shut across the country by 2026. That assumes e-commerce sales rise to represent 27% of total retail sales by then, up from 18% today. ""An enduring legacy of the pandemic is that online penetration rose sharply,"" Lasser said in a note to clients. ""We expect that it will continue to increase, which will drive further rationalization of retail stores, especially as some of the unique support measures from the government subside."" Even though more Americans are increasingly ordering everything from milk and bread to desk chairs to sneakers on the internet, store openings are outpacing closures for the first time in years. Many businesses are seizing the moment to take advantage of cheaper rents and ample vacant space to pick from. The growth largely stems from retailers that sell in beauty, grocery and discount goods, including Ulta, Dollar General, TJX and Lidl, which are anticipating a strong post-pandemic rebound in visits to stores. U.S. retailers have announced 3,169 store closures and 3,535 store openings so far this year, according to data complied by Coresight Research. The firm tracked 9,832 closures in 2019 — the highest it's seen since it started following this data. That figure fell to 8,741 in 2020. UBS said the retail industry has been supported recently by government stimulus and by consumers shifting their dollars to goods from services, with travel and other entertainment events on pause due to the pandemic. But it said those trends are going to be short-lived, leading to a predicted downturn in retail sales, which will result in an uptick in retail closures. UBS anticipates the most closures will be found among retailers that sell clothing and accessories in the years ahead. The firm is forecasting about 21,000 closures from this sector by 2026, with many of the shuttered stores located in enclosed shopping malls. Office-supplies and sporting-goods businesses are also forecast to be among the hardest hit. Closures are anticipated to be the most modest in home improvement, grocery and auto parts retailing, as these categories are less susceptible to harm with the rise of e-commerce, UBS said. — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",2021-04-05 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/05/store-closures-ubs-predicts-80000-stores-will-go-dark-by-2026.html?&qsearchterm=,7,512
"UBS first-quarter profit up 14%, but CEO 'very disappointed' with hit from Archegos scandal","The Swiss lender said revenues were $774 million lower as a result of the Archegos hedge fund's collapse.UBS CEO Ralph Hamers told CNBC the bank was ""very disappointed"" by the loss and had started a review into its prime brokerage business.The bank's net income for the first quarter came in at $1.8 billion, beating analyst expectations and up 14% from a year earlier.","In this article LONDON — UBS reported on Tuesday net income of $1.8 billion for the first quarter of 2021, as it revealed a hit to earnings from the scandal involving Archegos Capital. UBS shares were down almost 2% in early European trading hours. The Swiss bank said revenues were $774 million lower as a result of the default by the Archegos hedge fund, which collapsed last month after taking on too much risk. The U.S.-based family office was a client of UBS' prime brokerage business. UBS said Tuesday it had exited all exposure to Archegos and any related losses in the second quarter would be ""immaterial"" for the bank. A number of banks have been affected by the scandal, including Credit Suisse, which reported last week a net loss for the quarter on the back of a 4.4 billion Swiss franc ($4.8 billion) hit from the collapse of the same U.S. hedge fund. Speaking to CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche on Tuesday, UBS CEO Ralph Hamers said the bank was ""very disappointed"" by the hit. ""We are taking it very seriously. We have started a very detailed review of the different prime brokers' relationships that we have, the family offices' relationship that we have as well, the risk management processes that we have, in order to really get the lessons learned and make sure we implement them so that going forward it doesn't happen again,"" he said. Hamers added that the prime brokerage business was ""strategic"" and that its capabilities support the wider business, but nonetheless UBS needed to learn from what happened with Archegos. UBS' net income for the first quarter marked a 14% increase from a year earlier. Analysts had expected the figure to come in at $1.6 billion over the period, according to Refinitiv. Other highlights for the quarter: Hamers said the bank had seen ""continuous heightened client activity"" this quarter. ""Actually performance was really strong across wealth management, asset management, the investment bank and also the activities here in Switzerland,"" he told CNBC. ""So from that perspective actually a real, well balanced and strong quarter if it weren't for the loss that we also had to take, but even after the loss, we performed at a 18.2% return on CET1, which is a really good result."" Going forward, UBS said that revenues in the second quarter will be affected by ""seasonal factors,"" such as lower client activity compared to the first three months of the year. The Swiss bank expects a positive effect from higher asset prices, but warned that there is ""continued uncertainty"" about the economic recovery, which could impact its next earnings. ""We should all be aware there is a lot of optimism in the market and clearly there is a lot of good news that has come to the market, but I would also want to look at some of the challenges that we see. Will the pandemic be over? That is the question. Will vaccination continue the way it is? How will the economy truly recover?""

Archegos hit to UBS stuns investors as shares slide,"UBS shares dropped by almost 3% in mid-morning European trade, after reporting that it took a $774 million hit in the first quarter as a result of Archegos' default.The Swiss bank waited until its results day to inform markets about its exposure to the firm, a move that has sparked questions about transparency in the industry.","In this article LONDON — UBS surprised market participants on Tuesday, announcing that profits had taken a hit from the Archegos Capital saga — almost a month after the collapse of the U.S. hedge fund. The Swiss bank waited until its results day to inform markets about its exposure to the firm, a move that has sparked questions about transparency in the industry. ""What I am surprised about here is the fact that they didn't disclose this earlier,"" Storm Uru, a manager at Liontrust Global Dividend Fund, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday. UBS shares dropped by almost 3% in mid-morning European trade, after reporting that it took a $774 million hit in the first quarter as a result of Archegos' default. Maria Rivas, senior vice president at DBRS Morningstar, said the announcement from UBS ""was surprising given that the bank had not made any indication to the market on this issue before."" Different banks have been hit by the collapse of Archegos, which took on too much risk and defaulted on margin calls in March. Credit Suisse, Nomura, Deutsche Bank, Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs have been caught in the crossfire, although some managed to exit their positions sooner than others. For Credit Suisse, for instance, its involvement in Archegos meant it took a hit of 4.4 billion Swiss francs ($4.8 billion), which significantly impacted the bank's performance in the first quarter of the year. Credit Suisse also said last week that it expects to take an additional loss in the second quarter of around 600 million Swiss francs. ""UBS took a similar approach to Morgan Stanley and reported the impact on the announcement of results,"" Rivas said. Morgan Stanley was among the named banks that quickly sold their exposure to Archegos. Nonetheless it reported two weeks ago a $644 million loss from a ""credit event,"" as well as $267 million in related trading losses. ""Whilst unexpected, UBS hit from the prime brokerage client default dragged the overall Investment Banking division performance down, but the impact was more than offset by strong revenue performance,"" Rivas added. Speaking to CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche on Tuesday, UBS CEO Ralph Hamers said the bank was ""very disappointed"" by the hit. ""We are taking it very seriously. We have started a very detailed review of the different prime brokers' relationships that we have, the family offices' relationship that we have as well, the risk management processes that we have, in order to really get the lessons learned and make sure we implement them so that going forward it doesn't happen again,"" he said. Other banks are also investigating what went wrong with Archegos. Uru from Liontrust, who indicated that he had no holdings of UBS, believes further transparency in the future could put an end to some of the issues in banking. ""Clearly this had had an impact on UBS and maybe as we move forward based on stronger governance transparency, maybe we won't have these issues,"" he said.  ",2021-04-27 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/27/archegos-hit-to-ubs-stuns-investors-as-shares-slide.html?&qsearchterm=,8,496

However, the market rally may be short-lived given concerns over China's slowing economic growth, the bank indicated.

"The Indian rupee has had a stable run this year, but UBS expects it will be 'short-lived'","UBS strategists expect the Indian currency to weaken to 77 per dollar by the end of the year — more than 5% weaker than current levels — and depreciate further to 79.5 by September 2022.The rupee's resilience has primarily been because of two reasons: first, foreign fund flows into the Indian market and second, the Reserve Bank of India's management of the volatility, according to Gaurang Somaiya from Motilal Oswal.British bank HSBC expects the rupee to hold up ""relatively well"" in a stronger dollar environment as persistent FDI inflows and better foreign-exchange reserves will help the currency withstand external headwinds.","In this article The Indian rupee has been one of the most stable currencies in Asia-Pacific this year, but its stability is expected to be short-lived, according to UBS. Strategists from the Swiss investment bank said in a note dated Aug. 25 that they expect the Indian currency to weaken to 77 per dollar by the end of the year — more than 5% weaker than current levels — and depreciate further to 79.5 by September 2022. ""We see the year-to-date INR stability as short-lived,"" UBS said, adding that a retreat in U.S. bond yields lent stability to currencies like the rupee. The rupee changed hands at around 72.98 per dollar on Friday, strengthening some 0.19% from January levels and appreciating from levels around 74.11 last month. The rupee's resilience has been primarily driven by two factors, according to Gaurang Somaiya, a foreign-exchange analyst at the Mumbai-based diversified financial services firm Motilal Oswal. ""First, consistent fund flows was positive for the rupee and second was the [Reserve Bank of India] bought dollars to build its reserves and prepare itself for any volatility,"" he told CNBC. Somaiya added that fund flows were not only led by the foreign institutional investors but also through a consistent stream of foreign direct investments. FDI equity inflow into India grew 168% on-year to $17.57 billion between April and June — the first quarter in India's fiscal year 2022. That refers to foreign money invested into Indian markets as well as businesses and is free of debt. ""Fund flows have been one of the major reasons that helped the rupee gain steadily,"" Somaiya said. He pointed out that between August last year and now, the rupee has been stuck in a relatively broad range of 72 and 75 against the dollar. That suggests the RBI has been ""very active in managing the volatility of the rupee,"" using its interventions to build up its foreign exchange reserves to near all-time highs, he said. Latest data showed the RBI had about $616.9 billion in foreign exchange reserves as on Aug. 20. Somaiya said he expects the rupee to appreciate in the near term, following sharp gains in the domestic stock market. He predicted the currency could appreciate to levels near 72.20 against the dollar by the end of the year. In 2022, he expects the rupee to trade around the 73.50 to 74 level as the U.S. currency strengthens. Last year, India recorded a current account surplus for the first time in over a decade due to a collapse in domestic demand for imports as a result of the pandemic. That implied the value of incoming goods, services and investments into India was lower than the amount that left the country. In the first three months of this year, India's current account deficit widened to $8.1 billion, or 1% of GDP, as the economy slowly recovered. UBS strategists said India's quarterly current account balance has deteriorated rapidly from last year, driven by a rebound in oil prices. ""Given our expectations for India's current account deficit to persist in a 1-1.5% range into 2022, we expect the [rupee] to come under pressure when US yields start to rebound toward 2% by year-end,"" they said. British investment bank HSBC has a more positive view on the Indian currency. It expects the rupee to reach 73 against the dollar by year-end and says the currency will likely end flat with its end-2020 level. In the longer term, the bank expects modest weakness where the rupee could weaken to 75 against the dollar. HSBC expects the rupee to hold up ""relatively well"" in a stronger dollar environment as persistent FDI inflows and better foreign-exchange reserves will help the currency withstand external headwinds, Madan Reddy, Asia foreign-exchange strategist at HSBC Global Research, told CNBC. ""The uncertainty around slowing sequential global growth and the Fed's policy normalisation should therefore leave the [rupee] as an outperformer in Asia,"" he said. U.S. Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell last month indicated that the central bank is likely to begin withdrawing some of its easy-money policies before the end of the year, though he still sees interest rate hikes off in the distance. Reddy said the likelihood of tighter monetary conditions in the U.S. and a re-widening of India's current account deficit point to a higher dollar/rupee pair. But, he added, excessive weakness in the rupee is less likely as the RBI would eventually remove excess liquidity conditions from the economy and restrain inflation expectations. He pointed out the central bank's foreign-exchange purchases in recent years have helped suppress longer-term depreciation expectations among local traders. ""In our view, the RBI's FX policy will continue to remain a key driver of rupee's performance,"" Reddy said, adding that he sees little incentive for the central bank to tolerate the rupee's strength as long as capital inflows are not broad-based. ""For now, the RBI seems to be comfortable with [dollar/rupee] oscillating within its year-to-date trading range of 72.5-75.5,"" he said. Motilal Oswal's Somaiya added that domestic factors like growth recovery are more in favor of a stronger rupee, but global factors could cap gains against the dollar.       ",2021-09-06 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/09/06/indian-rupee-inr-outlook.html?&qsearchterm=,3,856

""We do expect, on the M&A side, on the advisory side, and even on the equity capital markets side, it continues momentum there — investors are still seeking to invest,"" Hamers told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore. ""We expect them to stay constructive for the foreseeable couple of months."" When it comes to crypto, which has gained in popularity as some investors look for sizeable and fast returns, Hamers said there was still too much uncertainty for the bank to offer these products to their clients. Last week, bitcoin notched a fresh all-time high as investors cheered the successful launch of the first U.S. bitcoin futures exchange-traded fund. ""At this moment, we stay on the sidelines there,"" the UBS CEO said. ""We feel that the market hasn't really come to a point where people truly understand the underlying factors that influence the value of some of these cryptocurrencies.""",2021-10-26 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/10/26/ubs-earnings-q3-2021.html?&qsearchterm=,2,334

UBS, Barclays, RBS, HSBC and Credit Suisse were fined a combined total of 344 million euros ($390 million), the commission said in a statement Thursday. The investigation, focused on the trading of G-10 currencies, revealed that foreign exchange traders in these five banks discussed sensitive information and trading plans. They occasionally coordinated their trading plans via a professional online chatroom called Sterling Lads, the commission said. Four of the banks' fines — UBS, Barclays, RBS and HSBC — were discounted by 10% as they acknowledged their participation in the cartel. Credit Suisse did not benefit from this reduction as it did not cooperate with authorities, the commission said. Its fine was reduced by 4% to reflect that the bank was not liable for all aspects of the case, however. UBS ultimately does not have to pay any fine as the bank received ""full immunity"" for revealing the existence of the cartel. ""Our cartel decisions to fine UBS, Barclays, RBS, HSBC and Credit Suisse send a clear message that the Commission remains committed to ensure a sound and competitive financial sector that is essential for investment and growth,"" Margrethe Vestager, Europe's competition chief, said in a statement. Barclays, Credit Suisse and HSBC declined to comment. A spokesperson for NatWest, the parent company of RBS, told CNBC via email: ""We are pleased to have reached this settlement regarding serious misconduct that took place in a single chatroom, and that involved a former employee of the bank, around a decade ago."" UBS said via email: ""This is a legacy matter where UBS was the first bank to disclose potential misconduct and we are pleased the matter is resolved."" Earlier this year, the commission had also found seven investment banks guilty of breaching its antitrust rules during the 2008 global financial crisis, with three of the banks receiving fines.",2021-12-03 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/02/barclays-rbs-hsbc-credit-suisse-ubs-fined-for-forex-trading-cartel.html?&qsearchterm=,6,324
"UBS says Chinese stock valuations are 'very attractive,' but don't expect a quick rebound","Chinese stocks currently look ""very, very attractive,"" but are unlikely to see a quick turnaround in the next few months, according to UBS Global Wealth Management's Kelvin Tay.The Chinese markets have underperformed by about 40% relative to peers in the U.S. and Europe, Tay said.Looking ahead, Tay said Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies are ""likely to be far more attractive"" as compared with those on the mainland.","Chinese stocks currently look ""very, very attractive,"" but are unlikely to see a quick turnaround in the next few months, according to UBS Global Wealth Management's Kelvin Tay. ""I think China is cheap. If you look at the performance of China this year, on a relative basis, it has actually underperformed by about 40% against both the European indices as well as the American indices,"" Tay, regional chief investment officer at UBS Global Wealth Management, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Tuesday. As of Tuesday's market close, China's CSI 300 index, which tracks the largest mainland-listed stocks, has fallen nearly 5% for the year. In Hong Kong, where many of China's tech titans are listed, the Hang Seng index has plummeted more than 14% in the same period. In comparison, the S&P 500 on Wall Street rose to a new record close — its 69th in 2021 — as recently as Monday. Over in Europe, the pan-European Stoxx 600 has gained more than 22% for 2021 as of its Tuesday close. ""From a valuations perspective, from a positioning perspective, China certainly looks very, very attractive,"" Tay said. He warned, however, that the Chinese market is unlikely to recover in the next three months due to a ""distinct lack of catalysts"" presently. He cited the need for China's property space to settle before the market can turn around. Investors have largely shunned the Chinese real estate sector this year amid concerns over defaults as developers faced a credit crunch. In December, debt-laden property developer China Evergrande Group slipped into default after failing to confirm payment of a debt obligation. ""We do think that things actually starting to turn around but it's just that, you know, on the issuers front, on the Chinese high-yield front, you're probably still going to get some news, some negative news on a couple of developers blowing up, filing for defaults, filing for bankruptcies,"" Tay said. Such negative developments are likely to hurt sentiment, he warned: ""If sentiment is fragile in the Chinese market right now, any small negative news is likely to be amplified and become big, and that in turn is going to actually affect the market as a whole."" JPMorgan picks China stocks to buy now. Alibaba's not on the list Portfolio manager explains why he has the 'most conviction' in this China tech stock China's version of Spotify is 'underappreciated,' Morgan Stanley says Goldman Sachs loves this sub-sector in China — and names 3 stocks to buy Looking ahead, Tay said Hong Kong-listed Chinese companies — which were ""beaten down really, really badly"" this year — are ""likely to be far more attractive"" as compared with their peers on the mainland. ""The policy risk tightening, we do think that most of that is actually over and done with,"" the chief investment officer explained. ""What you're going to get going forward is probably fine tuning of the measures and not, you know, an unleashing of an overhaul of the system similar to what we had in the tuition industry in July this year."" Another factor that is set to give Hong Kong-listed Chinese stocks a relative boost is expectations for a weakening in the yuan next year. ""The renminbi has been very, very strong,"" Tay said. ""The government has actually stressed on a couple of occasions that they're not quite comfortable with the outperformance of the renminbi vis a vis the other currencies over the last six months."" As of Wednesday afternoon during Asia trading hours, the onshore yuan has strengthened more than 2% against the dollar for 2021, while its offshore counterpart has gained nearly 2% against the greenback. ""We do expect the renminbi to actually weaken in 2022,"" Tay said, adding that will likely affect the performance of mainland-listed Chinese stocks given their ""very tight"" correlation with the yuan.",2021-12-29 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/12/29/ubs-chinese-stock-valuations-attractive-dont-expect-quick-rebound.html?&qsearchterm=,2,637

The Swiss bank also set ambitious new profitability targets as part of a strategic update. UBS posted net profit attributable to shareholders of $1.35 billion for the fourth quarter, down from $1.64 billion a year earlier and also lower than the $2.28 billion reported in the previous quarter. Analysts had forecast UBS to post net income attributable to shareholders of $863 million, according to the consensus published by the bank. ""The fourth quarter was a very good ending to a record year, the best year in 15 years, both from a pre-tax and a post-tax perspective,"" CEO Ralph Hamers told CNBC on Tuesday. ""The markets business held up really well with an operating income of 11% increase year-on-year, we saw net new money in the asset manager at $16 billion and we saw $27 billion of fee-generating assets coming in in the wealth manager,"" he said. The quarterly figures take the bank's full-year profit to $7.46 billion, above a company-compiled consensus of $6.98 billion and 14% higher than the previous year. However, UBS' bottom line was hit by an increase of $740 million in litigation provisions for a French cross-border tax case. In late December, the bank filed an appeal with France's Supreme Court against a decision by a Paris appeals court to uphold a money laundering conviction, although with a reduced penalty. Hamers said the bank was still assessing how best to approach the ongoing appeal against the ruling. ""Given the fact that you have another verdict here, we also looked at the overall case, whether we needed to change the provision that we already had,"" he told CNBC. ""Our best estimate at this moment in time, in terms of what could be payable at a certain moment in time, is 1.1 billion euro [$1.24 billion], and therefore we had to increase our provisioning by another 650 million euros, which is $740 million."" Here are other highlights for the third quarter: ""We are aiming to create sustainable value through the cycle. Reflecting our improved operating performance over the last two years, we have updated our financial targets, while our capital guidance remains unchanged,"" the bank said in a statement accompanying the results. In its first major strategic update since Hamers took the reins in Nov. 2020, UBS said it will aim for $6 trillion in invested assets across its global wealth management, asset management and personal and corporate banking divisions. Meanwhile, the bank set the target range for its return on CET1 capital at 15-18% and cost-to-income ratio at 70-73%. The bank will also aim for 10-15% growth in profit before tax at its wealth management business. ""Our new aspirations, targets and goals will position us to live up to our purpose, better serve clients, deploy technology in differentiated and impactful ways, and open our ecosystem for new and existing clients,"" CEO Ralph Hamers added in a statement. UBS proposed a dividend to shareholders of 50 cents per share for 2021, rising from 37 cents in 2020, and aims to buy back $5 billion worth of its own shares in 2022.

","Gold prices have been buoyed in recent weeks as investors seek safe-havens amid fears of Russia invading Ukraine, but in the longer term, UBS Investment Bank's Joni Teves predicts that recent strength in gold prices will be ""short-lived."" She spoke to CNBC on Monday, before Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered forces into two breakaway regions of eastern Ukraine, after he announced the Kremlin will recognize their independence.  Spot gold recently crossed the $1,900 level, last sitting at $1,908.13 per ounce in the morning of Asia trading hours on Tuesday. That's sharply higher than levels around $1,800 seen in early February. The latest escalation in Ukraine raised doubts over the potential for a diplomatic resolution to the ongoing crisis. U.S. President Joe Biden has since ordered sanctions on the separatist regions of Ukraine, with the European Union also vowing additional measures. Gold is traditionally seen as a safe investment during times of uncertainty. Looking ahead, Teves said the gold market is expected to revert back to focusing on macro drivers such as real rates, U.S. Federal Reserve policy as well as the growth outlook. In fact, UBS sees gold prices falling to $1,600 per ounce by the end of 2022. ""An environment where real rates are rising and the Fed is tightening policy does provide a negative backdrop for gold,"" she said. ""We do think that the strength should ultimately … be short-lived."" As the end of the current quarter approaches, the Fed is widely expected to raise interest rates at its March meeting to cool inflationary pressures, and Teves said that's likely to put pressure on gold. Expectations for higher interest rates tend to push yields of assets such as U.S. Treasurys higher, potentially lowering the attractiveness of a non-yielding asset such as gold.

""I think the key risk here is if we start to see reallocation into gold, with the expectation that although real rates are moving higher they are likely to remain in negative territory, and therefore an allocation to gold remains attractive,"" the strategist said.

"UBS expects 50,000 store closures in the U.S. over the next 5 years after pandemic pause","While analysts at UBS see more pain ahead, it's not as many closures as the investment bank had initially projected about a year ago. UBS is now projecting between 40,000 to 50,000 retail stores in the United States closing over the next five years, down from the 80,000 closures it previously forecasted. ","A pandemic shakeup in 2020 led to a surge in store closures, coupled with dozens retailers filing for bankruptcy, which emptied out shopping malls and left vacancies scattered along the streets major markets including New York City. The aftermath, though, was a temporary relief from closures, as companies took the chance in 2020 to quickly slim down their store counts when consumers were holed up at home. In fact, in 2021, retailers reported net store openings, marking a sudden reversal from years of net declines. Companies seized the opportunity to take advantage of cheap rents and an eagerness among Americans to get out and shop again. While analysts at UBS see more pain ahead, it's not as many closures as the investment bank had initially projected about a year ago. Brick-and-mortar shops have proven to serve a critical role for retailers' businesses during the Covid pandemic, the bank said in a new report on Wednesday, and retail sales growth has remained strong, in part due to rising inflation. This all bodes well for the future of physical stores, according to UBS retail analyst Michael Lasser. UBS is now projecting between 40,000 to 50,000 retail stores in the United States closing over the next five years, down from the 80,000 closures it previously forecasted. That's out of about 880,000 total retail stores that the firm tracks nationwide, excluding gas stations. This estimate assumes that U.S. retail sales grow about 4% annually, moving forward, and that e-commerce sales as a percentage of total retail sales grows to 25% by 2026, from 18% in 2021, Lasser said in the report. UBS sees the most closures shaking out among clothing and accessories retailers, consumer electronics businesses and home furnishing chains, or about 23,500 cumulatively within these categories by 2026. Traditional shopping malls remain at higher risk for closures than neighborhood strip centers, the firm said. That's in large part because shopper traffic to malls, often anchored by department store chains, has been pressured in recent years as consumers favor quick trips to stores closer to where they live. Meanwhile, general merchandise retailers, such as Target and Walmart, and auto parts businesses are expected to report net openings in the years ahead. According to Lasser and his team, there is still about 58 square feet of shopping center space per household in the U.S., as of 2021. While that's down from the 62 square feet per household in 2010, it's above 55 square feet in 2000 and 49 square feet in 1990. As consumers shift more of their spending onto the web, it only makes sense that that number would shrink, Lasser explained. So far this year, retailers' plans to open new locations are far outpacing their plans to shutter shops. Tracking data by Coresight Research show U.S. retailers having announced just 1,385 store closures, compared with a whopping 3,694 openings, as of April 1. The store growth is being driven by dollar chains and discount stores, like Dollar General and TJX – and also by a wave of so-called digitally native companies that started on the internet but are now seeking acquiring new customers via bricks and mortar. Some examples include Warby Parker, Allbirds, Vuori, Brooklinen and Fabletics. UBS, which releases these closely followed, deep-dive store closure reports every few years, said that the number of shopping centers in the U.S. reached a peak of 115,000 last year, up from 90,000 in 2000, despite a continued acceleration in e-commerce.",2022-04-13 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/13/ubs-50000-retail-store-closures-in-us-by-2026-after-pandemic-pause.html?&qsearchterm=,5,575
UBS beats expectations for the first quarter; continues to reduce Russia exposure,"UBS reported net profit attributable to shareholders of $2.136 billion, above forecasts compiled by the bank of $1.79 billion.The bank also said it had reduced its exposure to Russia to $0.4 billion as of March 31, compared with $0.6 billion at the end of 2021.On central bank activity, UBS CEO Ralph Hamers said: ""The ECB will closely look at what the Fed is doing and the Fed is ahead of the ECB. But also, [it's] a bit late, let's be honest.""","In this article UBS has beat expectations for the first quarter of 2022 and said it has further reduced its exposure to Russia. The Swiss bank on Tuesday reported net profit attributable to shareholders of $2.136 billion, above forecasts compiled by the bank of $1.79 billion. It marks a 17% rise from the $1.82 reported for the same period of 2021 and follows a drop in quarterly net profit to $1.35 billion at the end of the year. The bank has previously described its market risk exposure to Russia as ""limited"" and on Tuesday said it had reduced its exposure to $0.4 billion as of March 31, compared with $0.6 billion at the end of 2021. In addition, it said it had no material exposure to Ukraine or Belarus, and that it is not conducting any new business in Russia or with Russia-based clients. ""Macroeconomic, geopolitical and market factors created a high level of uncertainty in the first quarter, with Russia's invasion of Ukraine, COVID-related restrictions and lockdowns, higher volatility, the lower economic growth outlook, and concerns about higher inflation and the monetary policy response,"" the bank said in a release Tuesday. Speaking to CNBC's Geoff Cutmore Tuesday, UBS CEO Ralph Hamers said: ""It is pretty unpredictable out there."" Here are some other key metrics for the quarter: The company's stock traded almost 2% higher shortly after markets opened in Europe. A key uncertainty on the horizon is how central banks will react to higher inflation — and this can have direct consequences on banks' performance. ""The ECB will closely look at what the [U.S. Federal Reserve] is doing and the Fed is ahead of the ECB. But also, [it's] a bit late, let's be honest. So the ECB is a little bit late as well, because they don't want to ... be faster than the Fed,"" Hamers told CNBC. The European Central Bank has said it will end its asset purchases program in June, but has not yet given a precise timeline for when it might increase interest rates. ""We do expect that there will be a first hike in rates towards the end of the year on the ECB side,"" Hamers said. Another issue facing the European economy is whether the war in Ukraine will drag it into recession. European leaders have imposed tough sanctions on Russia and are considering further measures to punish the Kremlin, including a possible ban on oil imports. When asked if oil and natural gas sanctions on Russia could pose a risk for Europe, Hamers said: ""Of Russian oil not so much, of Russian gas that's a different — a much bigger challenge and that is really because large part[s] of industries are dependent on gas as their base commodity to make their product ... so that's what could cause the second order effect specifically in the European economy.""",2022-04-26 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/04/26/ubs-earnings-q1-2022-.html?&qsearchterm=,2,476

UBS misses expectations; CEO cites one of the 'most challenging' quarters for investors in a decade,"UBS posted net profit attributable to shareholders of $2.108 billion, below analyst expectations aggregated by the Swiss bank.As market declines accelerated across equity and fixed income in the second quarter, the bank's wealth management division took a hit.However CEO Ralph Hamers told CNBC this had been largely offset by rising interest rates, with the U.S. Federal Reserve embarking on an aggressive hiking cycle in a bid to reel in inflation.","UBS on Tuesday missed expectations for the second quarter of 2022 as its wealth management and investment banking divisions saw falling client activity on the back of the global market downturn. The Swiss bank posted a net profit attributable to shareholders of $2.108 billion, below analyst expectations aggregated by the company of $2.403 billion. It marks a 5% rise from the $2 billion reported during the same period last year, when the flagship wealth management business saw a significant windfall from wealthy investors, and follows a strong first-quarter that saw the group post a net profit of $2.136 billion. ""The second quarter was one of the most challenging periods for investors in the last 10 years. Inflation continues to be high, the war in Ukraine is ongoing, as are strict Covid policies in parts of Asia,"" UBS CEO Ralph Hamers said in a statement. ""In these uncertain times, our clients rely on our powerful ecosystem to navigate markets and invest for the long term."" Other highlights for the quarter: Investment banking revenues came in at $2.094 billion, down 14% from the same period last year. In its report, the bank highlighted a $1.121 billion fall in net fee and commission income, mainly reflecting a ""decrease in underwriting fees, particularly in Equity Capital Markets, and a decrease in net brokerage fees due to lower levels of client activity in Global Wealth Management and the Investment Bank."" ""Investment fund fees decreased, reflecting negative market performance and lower performance fees, and revenues from merger and acquisition transactions also decreased,"" the report added. Although the wealth management business took a hit from a broad decline in markets, Hamers said this had been largely offset by rising interest rates, with the U.S. Federal Reserve embarking on an aggressive hiking cycle in a bid to reel in inflation. ""On our recurring revenues, you see a decrease because of the level of the markets having gone down. You see on the transaction revenues a decrease as well because clients have been sidelining their investments,"" he told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore on Tuesday. ""However, you see a 24% uptick in net interest income on the back of rising rates, and as a consequence of that, the overall revenues in the wealth management business for the quarter were only -2% in very difficult circumstances."" As market declines accelerated across equity and fixed income in the second quarter, the bank's wealth management division saw muted net new fee-generating assets of around $400 million globally, though inflows were over $3 billion net positive in Asia-Pacific. ""On the one side, we saw already for a couple of quarters the trend of clients being lower on transactions, holding back on transactions,"" Hamers told CNBC on Tuesday. ""On the other side, we've seen specifically this quarter, really big net new fee-generating assets coming through – $3.3 billion in Asia-Pacific – which basically shows you that clients are moving away from transactions into mandate business, and that's been always part of our strategy."" The asset management business also saw $12 billion of outflows, primarily from equities.

GM and Ford shares fall after UBS downgrades on expectations for weakening demand,Shares of General Motors and Ford Motor each tumbled Monday.A pair of UBS downgrades cited expectations for weakening demand amid inflationary pressures.Shares of both GM and Ford are off about 45% year to date.,"In this article DETROIT — Shares of General Motors and Ford Motor each tumbled Monday after a pair of UBS downgrades citing expectations for weakening demand amid inflationary pressures. Ford's stock was down by more than 8% during intraday trading before closing at $11.37 per share, a decline of 6.9%. GM was off by as much as 7.5% before closing at $32.29 per share, down by 4%. Both GM and Ford shares are off about 45% year to date. Both companies have a market capitalization of just under $50 billion. UBS analyst Patrick Hummel wrote in notes to investors Monday that he expects the U.S. automotive industry to be challenging for the foreseeable future following record profit amid low supplies and high demand during the coronavirus pandemic. He predicted ""it will take three to six months for the auto industry to end up in oversupply, which will put an abrupt end to a 3-year phase of unprecedented"" pricing power and profit margins for the automakers.

Swiss bank UBS posts 24% profit slide but beats analyst expectations,"UBS is aiming to improve its business in Asia-Pacific and CEO Hamers said he sees ""some opportunities to grow"" in China.The investment banking division saw revenues down by 19% with the lower performance in equity derivatives, cash equities, and financing revenue being offset by revenues in foreign exchange.The Global Wealth Management division also reported lower revenues, down by 4% year-on-year.","In this article UBS on Tuesday reported a net income of $1.7 billion for the third quarter of this year, slightly above analyst expectations, with the Swiss bank citing a challenging environment. Analysts had expected a net profit of $1.64 billion, according to Refinitiv data. UBS reported a net income of $2.3 billion a year ago. The Swiss lender had missed expectations in the last quarter when it posted a net profit of $2.108 billion. The bank said at the time the second quarter had been ""one of the most challenging periods for investors in the last 10 years"" due to high inflation, the war in Ukraine and strict Covid-19 policies in Asia. UBS said Tuesday these factors continued to be in investors' minds in the third quarter. ""The macroeconomic and geopolitical environment has become increasingly complex. Clients remain concerned about persistently high inflation, elevated energy prices, the war in Ukraine and residual effects of the pandemic,"" Ralph Hamers, CEO of UBS, said in a statement. Speaking to CNBC's Geoff Cutmore, Hamers said, however, that there have been very strong flows into the business over the quarter, with net new fee-generating assets at $17 billion. Other highlights for the quarter included: Its investment banking division saw revenues down by 19% with the lower performance in equity derivatives, cash equities, and financing revenue being offset by revenues in foreign exchange. The Global Wealth Management division also reported lower revenues, down by 4% year-on-year. However, Personal and Corporate Banking revenues rose over the same period on more beneficial rates from the Swiss National Bank. Hamers noted Tuesday that clients on its wealth side were looking for alternative investments and cash, and he predicted that activity on the institutional side of its trading unit would remain weak in the fourth quarter. UBS is aiming to improve its business in Asia-Pacific and CEO Hamers said he sees ""some opportunities to grow"" in China. ""The confirmation of [China President] Xi for another term is on one side basically the confirmation of consistency going forward, so some of the policies that he has come out with over the last year will most likely be continued,"" Hamers said. He added that the Swiss bank looks at China ""by virtue of its demographics and some of the dimensions of the economy."" ""We think over time it is a very attractive place, so it is a strategic place,"" he added. Elsewhere, Hamers expects a ""challenging"" time for Europe given the ongoing energy crisis and war in Ukraine. ""Europe will have a challenging period, a challenging winter although they have their reserves,"" he said, adding that the Swiss bank expects the region to enter a recession. Shares of UBS were up by more than 4% in late morning European trade. ""We consider UBS's Q3 results were reasonably good considering the challenging operating environment although net attributable profit was down 24% compared to the same quarter the year before,"" Vitaline Yeterian, senior vice president at DBRS Morningstar, said via email.",2022-10-25 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/25/ubs-earnings-q3-2022.html?&qsearchterm=,7,499

The bank reported $1.7 billion of net income for the fourth quarter of last year, bringing its full-year profit to $7.6 billion in 2022. Analysts had expected UBS to post net income of $1.3 billion in the fourth quarter and of $7.3 billion for the year, according to Refinitiv data. The bank's Global Wealth Management unit posted a fourth-quarter increase in net interest income of 35% on the year, given higher deposit margins off the back of higher interest rates. Its Personal and Corporate Banking division also recorded a 21% year-on-year hike in net interest income over the same period, as a result of higher interest rates and loan revenues. But market uncertainty hit the investment banking and asset management arms of the business. The former saw a 24% yearly drop in revenues, whereas asset management revenues fell by 31% year-on-year due to the ""negative market performance and foreign currency effects."" ""The rate environment is helping the business on one side, and that offsets some of the lower activity that we see on the investment side,"" CEO Ralph Hamers told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore on Tuesday. He added that there had been a shift in the markets that put pressure on the investment side of the bank. ""We saw a move from what we would call micro focus, which is equity-focused, to macro focus, which is rates focused,"" he said, noting that the Swiss bank was not able to benefit from that transition as much as some of its peers, given its smaller presence in the U.S. Here are some other highlights from the results: Looking ahead, the Swiss lender said that revenues for the first quarter of 2023 were set to be ""positively influenced"" by higher client activity and interest rates, as well as by the easing of Covid-19 restrictions in Asia. However, it was cautious about the economic outlook more broadly, citing central bank activity as a potential catalyst for market volatility. ""While inflation may have peaked in the second half of 2022, and an energy crisis in Europe seems likely to be averted, the outlook for economic growth, asset valuations and market volatility remains highly uncertain, and central bank tightening may have an impact on market liquidity,"" the bank said its earnings release. UBS said it will be purchasing more of its own shares this year. ""We remain committed to a progressive dividend and expect to repurchase more than $5 billion of shares in 2023,"" Hamers said in a statement accompanying the results. Shares in the bank fell more than 2% in early European trade. ""UBS posted what we think are mixed fourth quarter results,"" analysts at Jefferies said in a Tuesday note.

"UBS offers to buy Credit Suisse for 'substantially' more than $1 billion, sources say",A sale to UBS comes after Credit Suisse shares logged their worst weekly decline since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.This despite an announcement that it would access a loan of up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the Swiss central bank.,"In this article Swiss banking giant UBS on Sunday has entered talks to buy its embattled rival Credit Suisse for ""substantially"" more than 1 billion Swiss francs, sources told CNBC's David Faber. The Financial Times reported that UBS has agreed to buy the bank for more than $2 billion, marking a substantial increase from the initial $1 billion offer the FT reported earlier Sunday. Faber said the price of the deal increased throughout the day's negotiations. The Swiss government is holding a news conference to address the deal at 2:30 p.m. ET. Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment on the reports when contacted by CNBC. Credit Suisse reportedly balked at UBS' initial offer, arguing it was too low and would hurt shareholders and employees, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg. Swiss authorities have also reportedly been considering full or partial nationalization of the bank as an alternative to the UBS takeover, according to a Sunday Bloomberg report. The UBS deal is being orchestrated quickly, so the Swiss are preparing for the case that it falls through, Bloomberg said, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The country is reportedly considering whether it would take over the bank completely or hold a significant equity stake. The UBS offer comes after Credit Suisse shares logged their worst weekly decline since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, despite an announcement that it would access a loan of up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the Swiss central bank. It had already been battling a string of losses and scandals, and last week sentiment was rocked again with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the shuttering of Signature Bank in the U.S., sending shares sliding. Credit Suisse's scale and potential impact on the global economy is much greater than the U.S. banks. The Swiss bank's balance sheet is around twice the size of Lehman Brothers when it collapsed, at around 530 billion Swiss francs as of end-2022. It is also far more globally inter-connected, with multiple international subsidiaries — making an orderly management of Credit Suisse's situation even more important. Credit Suisse lost around 38% of its deposits in the fourth quarter of 2022, and revealed in its delayed annual report early last week that outflows have still yet to reverse. It reported a full-year net loss of 7.3 billion Swiss francs for 2022 and expects a further ""substantial"" loss in 2023. The bank had previously announced a massive strategic overhaul in a bid to address these chronic issues, with current CEO and Credit Suisse veteran Ulrich Koerner taking over in July.

The Swiss National Bank also pledged a loan of up to 100 billion Swiss francs ($108 billion) to support the takeover. ,"In this article UBS agreed to buy its embattled rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion) Sunday, with Swiss regulators playing a key part in the deal as governments looked to stem a contagion threatening the global banking system. ""With the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, a solution has been found to secure financial stability and protect the Swiss economy in this exceptional situation,"" read a statement from the Swiss National Bank, which noted the central bank worked with the Swiss government and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority to bring about the combination of the country's two largest banks. The terms of the deal will see Credit Suisse shareholders receive 1 UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares they hold. ""This acquisition is attractive for UBS shareholders but, let us be clear, as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue. We have structured a transaction which will preserve the value left in the business while limiting our downside exposure,"" said UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher in a statement. The combined bank will have $5 trillion of invested assets, according to UBS. ""We are committed to making this deal a great success. There are no options in this,"" Kelleher said when asked during the press conference if the bank could back out of the deal. ""This is absolutely essential to the financial structure of Switzerland and ... to global finance."" The Swiss National Bank pledged a loan of up to 100 billion Swiss francs ($108 billion) to support the takeover. The Swiss government also granted a guarantee to assume losses up to 9 billion Swiss francs from certain assets over a preset threshold ""in order to reduce any risks for UBS,"" said a separate government statement. ""This is a commercial solution and not a bailout,"" said Karin Keller-Sutter, the Swiss finance minister, in a press conference Sunday. The UBS deal was scrambled together before markets reopened for trading Monday after Credit Suisse shares logged their worst weekly decline since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic. The losses came despite a new loan of up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) granted from the Swiss central bank last week, in an effort to halt the slide and restore confidence in the bank. News of the deal was welcomed by Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell in a statement. ""The capital and liquidity positions of the U.S. banking system are strong, and the U.S. financial system is resilient. We have been in close contact with our international counterparts to support their implementation,"" they said. Credit Suisse had already been battling a string of losses and scandals, and in the last two weeks, sentiment was rocked again as banks in the U.S. reeled from the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank. U.S. regulators' backstop of uninsured deposits in the failed banks and the creation of a new funding facility for troubled financial institutions failed to stem the shock and is threatening to envelop more banks both in the U.S. and abroad. Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann said in the press conference that the financial instability brought about by the collapsed U.S. regional banks hit the bank at the wrong time. Despite regulators' involvement in the pairing, the deal gives UBS autonomy to run the acquired assets as it sees fit, which could mean significant job cuts, sources told CNBC's David Faber. Credit Suisse's scale and potential impact on the global economy is much greater than U.S. regional banks, which pressured Swiss regulators to find a way to bring the country's two largest financial institutions together. Credit Suisse's balance sheet is around twice the size of Lehman Brothers' when it collapsed, at around 530 billion Swiss francs as of the end of 2022. It is also far more globally interconnected, with multiple international subsidiaries — making an orderly management of Credit Suisse's situation even more important. Bringing the two rivals together was not without its struggles, but pressure to stave off a systemic crisis won out in the end. UBS initially offered to buy Credit Suisse for around $1 billion Sunday, according to multiple media reports.

'Shotgun wedding': What the UBS rescue of Credit Suisse means for global markets,"Despite bold proclamations from Swiss authorities and central banks about a return to stability, the deal does not appear to have laid to rest concerns about systemic risks to global markets.The cut-price deal is expected to close this year and creates a banking behemoth with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets, but shares of both UBS and Credit Suisse plunged on Monday.While the deal could bring an end to doubts about the viability of Credit Suisse as a business, some analysts still believe the devil will be in the detail.","In this article In equal parts ""shotgun wedding"" and arranged marriage, UBS agreed to buy stricken domestic rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion) on Sunday. Despite bold proclamations from Swiss authorities and central banks about a return to stability, the deal does not appear to have laid to rest concerns about systemic risks to global markets. After years of heavy losses and costly scandals, Credit Suisse's most recent share price plunge began with the collapse of U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and was compounded when top investor the Saudi National Bank said it could not provide any more financial assistance. The announcement of a loan of up to 50 billion Swiss francs from the Swiss National Bank failed to soothe investor concerns and eventually necessitated the 167-year-old institution's ""emergency rescue"" by UBS. Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann told a press conference Sunday that the ""latest developments that emanated from the banks in the U.S. hit us at the most unfavorable moment."" ""The accelerating loss of confidence and the escalation over the last few days have made it clear that Credit Suisse can no longer exist in its current form,"" Lehmann said. ""We are happy to have found a solution, which I'm convinced will bring lasting stability and security for clients, staff, financial markets and to Switzerland."" The cut-price deal is expected to close this year and creates a banking behemoth with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets. The deal also includes support from the Swiss government, financial regulator FINMA, and the Swiss National Bank (SNB), which will offer a liquidity line of up to 100 billion Swiss francs, backed by a federal default guarantee. The government will offer a loss guarantee of up to 9 billion Swiss francs, with UBS assuming the first 5 billion of potential losses. Shares of both UBS and Credit Suisse plunged on Monday morning, however. Goldman Sachs said in a note late Sunday that the deal and associated liquidity and loss guarantees provided ""clarity"" and dampened tail risks. The U.S. bank has shifted back to an overweight allocation on European banks as a result. ""Of course, we are mindful that the situation among U.S. regional banks remains fluid. But as we discussed on Friday, we take comfort from the limited contagion from U.S. regional banks to larger money center banks, a trend we expect will persist,"" the Wall Street giant's credit strategists said. Goldman also reiterated its favorable view on U.S. ""money center"" banks, a view echoed by Smead Capital Management's CEO Cole Smead, who said interest rate rises from central banks help lenders ""that don't do stupid things in their assets."" ""Poor stock markets have caused investment banks to be the laggards, but commercial banks look good next to them,"" he said via email, naming JPMorgan and Bank of America as stocks he particularly likes. Smead also said investors could expect higher returns on assets from the new UBS-Credit Suisse entity, along with more consolidation in the European banking sector. But bigger questions remain over the potential market impact of the deal. James Sym, head of equities at London-based investment manager River and Mercantile, told CNBC that the market was in ""seek and destroy mode."" ""This solves what I think is probably an idiosyncratic problem at Credit Suisse, but I'm not sure it's a firebreak big enough to stop the rot for the market,"" he said Monday. Although he added that the rest of the European banking system is ""much more robust"" than it was."" Since the Global Financial Crisis, the continent's banks have built much larger capital buffers in order to withstand systemic risks. Sym suggested that if European bank shares fall significantly as a result of the deal, he might ""start to nibble"" at some stocks, potentially even UBS. ""In the short term, the market is not going to like this deal for UBS, it's not core to the strategy, but I think over the medium term it does potentially give them an edge to compete globally with the Americans and really puts them in an unassailable position domestically."" While the deal could bring an end to doubts about the viability of Credit Suisse as a business, some analysts still believe the devil will be in the detail as the finer points are hashed out over the coming weeks and months. ""One issue is that the reported price of $3.25bn (CHF0.5 per share) equates to ~4% of book value, and about 10% of Credit Suisse's market value at the start of the year,"" said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics. ""This suggests that a substantial part of Credit Suisse's $570bn assets may be either impaired or perceived as being at risk of becoming impaired. This could set in train renewed jitters about the health of banks."" Shearing added that there may yet be risks to the deal ""for legal or financial reasons, or if confidence in UBS is dented and it gets cold feet about the deal."" ""Only time will tell how this shotgun wedding is received,"" he added. As part of the deal, Swiss regulator FINMA announced the wipeout of 16 billion Swiss francs' worth of Credit Suisse's Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds, which some investors fear signals further spillover risk for global credit. This was a major focal point for analysts assessing the potential ramifications on Monday morning. ""AT1 bonds were introduced in Europe after the global financial crisis to serve as shock absorbers when banks start to fail,"" explained Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer at Syz Bank. ""They are designed to impose permanent losses on bondholders or be converted into equity if a bank's capital ratios fall below a predetermined level, effectively propping up its balance sheet and allowing it to stay in business. According to the Swiss bail-in regime, AT1 debt is above equity in the loss absorption waterfall."" The entire AT1 tranche of bonds being written down to zero, Monchau suggested, is an ""arresting development"" given that unsecured bondholders usually rank higher than equity holders in the capital structure. He argued that this raises questions about the real value of contingent convertible (CoCo) bonds and creates contagion risks. ""There is also a risk of spillover effect on global credit (although we note that senior secured bonds seem quite resilient including CS senior secured bonds which are jumping in price this morning),"" he added. Goldman highlighted that the write-down constitutes the largest loss ever inflicted on AT1 investors since the post-GFC birth of the asset class, and argued that although it preserves some shareholder value, the decision ""greatly weakens the case to add risk."" ""Whether investors treat this decision as a one-off or whether they rethink the asymmetry of their risk-reward at times of elevated financial distress remains to be seen,"" the bank's credit strategists said. ""But in our view, it has become harder to assess the attractiveness of the current historically large spread pick-up provided by AT1 bonds vs. their HY (high-yield) corporate counterparts, which will likely constrain the appetite towards the AT1 asset class.""",2023-03-20 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/20/what-ubs-rescue-of-credit-suisse-cs-means-for-markets-and-banks.html?&qsearchterm=,8,1178

""The country will now be viewed as a financial banana republic.""","In this article The demise of banking giant Credit Suisse sent shock waves through financial markets and appears to have dealt a blow to Switzerland's reputation for stability, with one executive suggesting investors will now look at the mountainous central European country as ""a financial banana republic."" UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, agreed on Sunday to buy its embattled domestic rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion) as part of a government-backed, cut-price deal. Swiss authorities and regulators helped to negotiate the agreement, which came amid fears of contagion to the global banking system after two smaller U.S. banks collapsed in recent weeks. The rescue deal means Switzerland, a country heavily dependent on finance for its economy, is on track to see its two biggest and best-known banks merge into just one financial giant. ""Switzerland's standing as a financial centre is shattered,"" Octavio Marenzi, CEO of Opimas, said in a research note. ""The country will now be viewed as a financial banana republic."" ""The Credit Suisse debacle will have serious ramifications for other Swiss financial institutions. A country-wide reputation with prudent financial management, sound regulatory oversight, and, frankly, for being somewhat dour and boring regarding investments, has been wiped away,"" Marenzi said. A spokesperson for the Swiss regulator FINMA declined to comment. Shares of Swiss-listed UBS on Tuesday rose 7.3% by around 12:50 p.m. London time (8:50 a.m. ET), extending gains after closing higher in the previous session. Credit Suisse traded up 3.5% during afternoon deals after ending Monday's session down a whopping 55%. Under the terms of the emergency takeover, investors in Credit Suisse's additional tier-one bonds — widely regarded as a relatively risky investment — will see the value of their holdings slashed to zero. It means investments worth roughly 16 billion francs will become worthless. AT1 bonds, also known as contingent convertibles or ""CoCos,"" are a type of debt that is considered part of a bank's regulatory capital. Holders can convert them into equity or write them down in certain situations – for example when a bank's capital ratio falls below a previously agreed threshold. ""The extraordinary government support will trigger a complete write-down of the nominal value of all AT1 debt of Credit Suisse in the amount of around CHF 16 billion, and thus an increase in core capital,"" FINMA said Sunday. The unconventional move is at odds with the typical practice of prioritizing bondholders over shareholders when a bank fails and prompted turmoil in the market for convertible bank bonds on Monday. Vítor Constâncio, who served as the vice president of the European Central Bank from 2010 to 2018, said via Twitter that FINMA's announcement was a ""mistake with consequences and potentially a host of court cases."" The ECB and Britain's Bank of England both sought to distance themselves from FINMA's decision.

Here's HSBC forecast European Union regulators, composed of the ECB, the European Banking Authority and the Single Resolution Board, said Monday that they would continue to impose losses on shareholders before bondholders. ""This approach has been consistently applied in past cases and will continue to guide the actions of the SRB and ECB banking supervision in crisis interventions,"" they said. The Bank of England echoed this sentiment shortly thereafter. ""Holders of such instruments should expect to be exposed to losses in resolution or insolvency in the order of their positions in this hierarchy,"" the BOE said. ""One feature of this whole banking pressure that we've seen over the last week or two is that actually yes we've seen major volatility in equity markets, major volatility in fixed income markets, and also commodity markets, but very little volatility in foreign exchange markets,"" Bob Parker, senior advisor at the International Capital Markets Association, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday. Asked about how investors might now think of Switzerland's reputation for stability, Parker replied, ""When I was in Zurich last week, this subject actually was a hot topic."" He said there had been ""some very modest"" weakness in the Swiss franc against the euro in recent days, noting that this is the currency pair the Swiss National Bank, the country's central bank, focuses on. One euro was last seen trading at 0.9961 Swiss francs, weakening from 0.9810 when compared with March 14. ""We've moved back close to parity on Swiss franc-euro. So, I think to answer your question, yes, to some extent the Swiss franc as a safe haven currency has lost some of its allure. There is no doubt about that,"" Parker said. ""Will that be regained? Probably yes, I would argue this is very much sort of a short-term effect,"" he added. — CNBC's Elliot Smith and Sophie Kiderlin contributed to this report.",2023-03-22 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/21/ubs-credit-suisse-deal-puts-switzerlands-reputation-on-the-line.html?&qsearchterm=,2,831

In a deal orchestrated by Swiss regulators, Switzerland's largest bank UBS agreed on March 19 to buy its embattled rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion). The move came as governments looked to stem a contagion threatening the global banking system. The leadership change comes ""in light of the new challenges and priorities facing UBS after the announcement of the acquisition,"" UBS said Wednesday. The statement pointed to how Ermotti ""successfully repositioned"" the bank following the 2008 global financial crisis, and ""achieved a profound culture change within the bank."" That allowed the Swiss lender to ""regain the trust of clients and other stakeholders, while restoring people's pride in working for UBS,"" the bank said. Hamers told employees of the government-orchestrated takeover that UBS ""did not buy Credit Suisse only to close it,"" Reuters reported. In the announcement, UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher called Hamers an ""outstanding"" CEO who led UBS to ""unprecedented success despite a challenging environment."" While the acquisition of Credit Suisse supports UBS' existing strategy, it imposes new priorities on the group, he said. ""With his unique experience, I am very confident that Sergio will deliver the successful integration that is so essential for both banks' clients, employees and investors, and for Switzerland,"" Kelleher said. The move surprised some market observers, but one analyst said it was just part of the fallout from the merger deal. As with ""all forced mergers or an acquisition of not equal parties, you can always have this friction and I think that's what you see at play here,"" Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, told CNBC on Wednesday. ""It was very clear that the now former CEO at UBS was not really happy about this shotgun wedding and I think that's the fallout you see now."" Notably, in an interview with Swiss newspaper NZZ am Sonntag in September, Ermotti argued that there was no ""compelling"" economic reason for Switzerland to have two big banks. ""Everything we have seen, I think, since the global financial crisis with regulation is leading us down one path, of bigger and bigger and banks, more and more concentration, which leads to fragility but also less competition and I'm not sure it's long term going to be good for the overall financial system,"" Garnry argued. ""It puts the conversation out there: are we moving towards more public interference with money itself?"" He said the discussions in the U.S. after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is, ""to what degree should there be guarantees on deposits above the FDIC deposit guarantee limit? If you do that, what is the purpose of having banks, private money etc?"" ""I think there are big questions here about this and where we're heading in the banking system,"" Garnry said. In a press briefing following the announcement, Kelleher stressed that Ermotti's Swiss nationality is a ""nice thing,"" but not a main driver behind the appointment decision. He stressed the ""significant execution risk"" of implementing UBS' takeover of Credit Suisse, noting the new CEO's expertise best equips him as the ""best pilot"" to navigate the challenge.  He signaled the Swiss government were advised of Ermotti's designation.  ""Clearly regulators have a right of saying no. So we have to make sure that there is approval and Sergio is approved for this role,"" he said.  Ermotti expressed interest to remain in the position long term, saying that the tasks ahead align with his vision for UBS. ""There is a sense in me, and I felt, a sense of call of duty aspect. And also, frankly speaking, I always thought that despite all these discussions around the size of the bank, I always felt that the next chapter I wanted to write back then was a chapter of doing a transaction like this one,"" he said.  Hamers noted that he has stepped aside in the interest of the new combined bank, of its stakeholders and of the broader Swiss nation. He said that the bank wants to ""take away uncertainty as soon as we can"" regarding its restructuring and prospective layoff plans. He downplayed the potential risks posed by the combined bank's scale:  ""I always say the big debate nowadays is not too big to fail, it's too small to survive."" Kelleher echoed the view, observing that UBS has a capital-light balance sheet and that the group's strategy is to downsize the non-core units of Credit Suisse as quickly as possible. Critically, he flagged the importance of matching the perspectives of the two banks:  ""There are cultural issues between Credit Suisse and UBS. We do not want to import a bad culture into UBS,"" he said, noting that the core of this cultural conflict was in the investment bank branch of reputationally-challenged Credit Suisse.  — CNBC's Lim Hui Jie contributed to this report.",2023-03-29 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/29/ubs-names-sergio-ermotti-as-its-new-ceo-following-acquisition-of-credit-suisse.html?&qsearchterm=,19,905
'Historic day': UBS sets out plans in first shareholder meeting since Credit Suisse takeover,"The 1,128 shareholders gathered in Basel are seeking clarity on the board's plan following the ""shotgun wedding"" between Switzerland's two biggest banks, which remains mired in controversy, legal peril and public skepticism.New CEO Sergio Ermotti takes the reins on Wednesday after his shock reappointment last week, as UBS takes on the mammoth task of integrating its fallen compatriot's business.","UBS sought to reassure investors at its annual general meeting on Wednesday against a fraught political backdrop following its takeover of fallen rival Credit Suisse last month. The 1,128 shareholders gathered in Basel were looking for clarity on the board's integration plan after the ""shotgun wedding"" between Switzerland's two biggest banks, which remains mired in controversy, legal peril and public skepticism. UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher told the audience that March 19, the date of the emergency rescue of Credit Suisse from the brink of collapse, was a ""historic day and a day we hoped would never come."" But he said the merger also presents ""a new beginning and huge opportunities ahead for the combined bank and the Swiss financial sector as a whole."" He emphasized UBS' continued focus on its wealth management and Swiss business and confirmed that the bank would reduce the capital allocated to its investment arm to below 25% of risk-weighted assets. ""Whilst we did not initiate these discussions, we believe that this transaction is financially attractive to UBS shareholders,"" Kelleher said, while acknowledging there is a ""huge amount of risk"" associated with the integration. The Credit Suisse integration is expected to take around three to four years, excluding Credit Suisse's non-core investment bank portfolio. Kelleher said the bank expects to remain well capitalized and ""significantly above"" its capital targets by the time the deal closes. New UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti began his second tenure on Wednesday after his shock reappointment last week, with the board having decided that he was the right man to lead the mammoth task of integrating the bank's fallen compatriot's business. Ermotti's return was seen by many commentators as an attempt to restore calm, as the country's long-established reputation for financial stability teeters on the brink. UBS reported a full-year profit of $7.6 billion in 2022, and its shares remain up more than 10% since the turn of the year. Concerns remain over the scale of the new entity, which will have more than $5 trillion in total invested assets, and whether it creates too much concentrated risk for the Swiss and global economy. Reports have suggested that UBS' plans may include job cuts of around 20-30% of the combined entity's global workforce, but the bank's Vice Chairman said Wednesday that it was too early to offer any concrete estimates. Credit Suisse held the final independent AGM in its 167-year history in Zurich on Tuesday, after Swiss authorities brokered an ""emergency rescue"" in late March, when the bank's share price tumbled and depositors fled en masse. The board was angrily confronted on Tuesday by shareholders demanding answers and accountability over the 3 billion Swiss franc ($3.3 billion) deal, which was rushed through over the course of a weekend and denied both UBS and Credit Suisse shareholders a vote. Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann said he was ""truly sorry"" to shareholders, clients and employees, and suggested the bank's turnaround plan after years of losses, scandals and compliance failures had been on track until turmoil in the U.S. banking sector sparked a flight of confidence. Peter V. Kunz, chair in Economic Law and Comparative Law at the University of Bern, told CNBC on Wednesday that the mood in Basel was ""totally different"" to that in Zurich on Tuesday. ""Yesterday, people were angry, they were frustrated. Basically, CS shareholders were the losers. Here, you see the winners,"" he told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche outside the meeting. ""They are gleeful, they are happy, they see the prospects of the future, some might even be triumphant because there was some bad blood between these two banks. They were rivals,"" Kunz added, though he acknowledged that some shareholders remain uncertain about the outlook for the combined entity. The Swiss Federal Prosecutor is investigating the state-backed takeover for potential breaches of Swiss federal law by government officials, regulators and top executives. Swiss regulator FINMA held a press conference on Wednesday setting out why the forced merger was the best possible outcome, and laying the blame squarely at the door of Credit Suisse management.",2023-04-05 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/05/ubs-holds-first-shareholder-meeting-since-controversial-credit-suisse-takeover.html?&qsearchterm=,8,673
"UBS expects $17 billion hit from Credit Suisse rescue, flags hasty due diligence","The bank's emergency acquisition of its stricken domestic rival for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.4 billion) was brokered by Swiss authorities over the course of a weekend in March. UBS also expects to offset this by booking a one-off $34.8 billion gain from so-called ""negative goodwill,"" which refers to the acquisition of assets at a much lower cost than their true worth.UBS highlighted that the short time frame under which it was forced to conduct due diligence may have affected its ability to ""fully evaluate Credit Suisse's assets and liabilities"" prior to the takeover.","UBS estimates a financial hit of around $17 billion from its emergency takeover of Credit Suisse, according to a regulatory filing, and said the rushed deal may have affected its due diligence. In a new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) late Tuesday night, the Swiss banking giant flagged a total negative impact of around $13 billion in fair value adjustments of the new combined entity's assets and liabilities, along with a potential $4 billion hit from litigation and regulatory costs. However, UBS also expects to offset this by booking a one-off $34.8 billion gain from so-called ""negative goodwill,"" which refers to the acquisition of assets at a much lower cost than their true worth. The bank's emergency acquisition of its stricken domestic rival for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.4 billion) was brokered by Swiss authorities over the course of a weekend in March, with Credit Suisse teetering on the brink of collapse amid massive customer deposit withdrawals and a plummeting share price. In the amended F-4 filing, UBS also highlighted that the short time frame under which it was forced to conduct due diligence may have affected its ability to ""fully evaluate Credit Suisse's assets and liabilities"" prior to the takeover. Swiss governmental authorities approached UBS on March 15 while considering whether to initiate a sale of Credit Suisse in order to ""calm markets and avoid the possibility of contagion in the financial system,"" the filing revealed. The bank had until March 19 to conduct its due diligence and return with a decision. ""If the circumstances of the due diligence affected UBS Group AG's ability to thoroughly consider Credit Suisse's liabilities and weaknesses, it is possible that UBS Group AG will have agreed to a rescue that is considerably more difficult and risky than it had contemplated,"" UBS said in the Risk Factors section of the filing. Though this is highlighted as a potential risk, UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti told CNBC last month that the Credit Suisse deal was not risky and would create long-term benefits. The most controversial aspect of the deal was regulator FINMA's decision to wipe out around $17 billion of Credit Suisse's additional tier-one (AT1) bonds before shareholdings, defying the conventional order of write downs and resulting in legal action from AT1 bondholders. Tuesday's filing showed the UBS Strategy Committee began evaluating Credit Suisse in October 2022 as its rival's financial situation worsened. The long-struggling lender experienced massive net asset outflows toward the end of 2022 on the back of liquidity concerns. The UBS Strategy Committee concluded in February that an acquisition of Credit Suisse was ""not desirable,"" and the bank continued to conduct analysis of the financial and legal implications of such a deal in case the situation deteriorated to the point that Swiss authorities would ask UBS to step in. UBS last week announced that Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Koerner will join the executive board of the new combined entity once the deal legally closes, which is expected within the next few weeks. The group will operate as an ""integrated banking group"" with Credit Suisse retaining its brand independence for the foreseeable future, as UBS pursues a phased integration.",2023-05-17 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/05/17/ubs-expects-17-billion-hit-from-credit-suisse-rescue-flags-hasty-due-diligence.html?&qsearchterm=,13,529
"Why wealthy Americans love UBS, the secretive Swiss banking giant","U.S. authorities claim that UBS and other Swiss banks repeatedly fail to disclose the allegedly criminal activity of clients.More than half of UBS's wealth management clients are based in the United States.UBS is one of roughly 30 global, systemically important banks that regulators protect in emergencies.UBS may inherit litigation risks after its acquisition of rival bank giant Credit Suisse.","In this article With its $3.2 billion acquisition of Credit Suisse, UBS is poised to climb the ranks of global mega banks. UBS is no stranger to blockbuster mergers. The modern company is comprised of over 370 legacy firms, including former domestic rivals. Amid major wars, Switzerland has remained stable and neutral, becoming a safe haven for global wealth. Today, international wealth management is the heart of UBS's operation. With over $5 trillion in invested assets post-merger, more than half of the bank's customers are based in the United States. Experts believe this is due to the unique levels of discretion offered by Swiss law. Bankers in Switzerland are bound to protect many client details, even when pressed by foreign authorities.  ""You can access their operations in Singapore, in New York, in more exotic places. But at the core, they will not be subject to some political influence because the Swiss government is leaving them alone, or at least that's the perception,"" said Nicolas Véron, a senior fellow at both the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, D.C., and the Bruegel think tank in Brussels. In recent years, both UBS and Credit Suisse have faced pressure from U.S. authorities to end what has been criticized as dubious business practices. For example, in the 2010s, thousands of instances of misconduct were uncovered at UBS in an international interest rate manipulation probe. Additionally, U.S. senators claim that Credit Suisse maintained accounts linked to Nazi clients as recently as 2020. Global watchdogs have worried for years that banks like UBS have become too big to fail. A sudden and rapid flight of depositors from Credit Suisse brought those fears to life. The Swiss National Bank pledged over $100 billion in liquidity support to broker UBS's rapid takeover of Credit Suisse. In the deal, Credit Suisse shareholders expect to trade in 22.48 shares for 1 UBS share. Some bondholders plan to challenge the deal in court. ""By and large, what the Swiss government mostly did is impose losses on creditors and shareholders of Credit Suisse,"" said Véron. UBS Group AG said the acquisition may make the bank more competitive globally, and that it is prepared to manage that increased complexity.

UBS says it has completed the takeover of stricken rival Credit Suisse,"UBS has completed the legal takeover of its former Swiss rival Credit Suisse.The $3.2 billion deal was agreed in March amid worries about Credit Suisse losses would destabilize the banking system.The enlarged UBS will have a balance sheet of $1.6 trillion and a workforce of 120,000.","In this article Swiss bank UBS on Monday said that it formally completed the takeover of its rival Credit Suisse. ""Instead of competing, we'll now unite as we embark on the next chapter of our joint journey,"" UBS Group's newly-returned CEO Sergio Ermotti said in a statement. In an open letter, the bank's chiefs also said they would not compromise UBS's ""strong culture"" or ""conservative risk approach."" Risk management failures over a number of years played a key role in Credit Suisse's eventual downfall. Ermotti told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" in a Monday interview that he believed the combined bank — which he said was the world's 21th largest — would ""compete better, serve our clients better."" ""We are the only bank with this kind of magnitude and size and scope that is focused on wealth management,"" Ermotti said. ""We need to make sure we don't fall back into any bad habits or do things the wrong way. But in that sense we have a very clear view on how to manage a UBS-led integration,"" he continued, as it seeks to ""restore confidence."" UBS Group will manage UBS and Credit Suisse as separate banks at least for the short term. Questions linger over the future of assets including Credit Suisse's prized retail bank. Following the acquisition, Credit Suisse and its American Depositary Shares will be delisted from the SIX Swiss Exchange and New York Stock Exchange, with shareholders receiving one UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares held. The enlarged UBS will have a balance sheet of $1.6 trillion and a workforce of 120,000. Ermotti previously warned the new group ""won't be able to create, short term, job opportunities for everybody. Synergies is part of the story."" The combined company will report its first consolidated results on August 31. UBS said Monday it expected ""Credit Suisse operating losses and significant restructuring charges"" to be offset as it ditches risk-weighted assets, and forecast a common equity tier 1 capital ratio — a measurement of capital against assets — of around 14% for the rest of the year. In an internal memo seen by CNBC, the bank announced that several senior Credit Suisse figures intend to leave the company, including Chief Financial Officer Dixit Joshi, who only took on the role in October, and Asia Pacific regional CEO Edwin Low. Simon Grimwood, currently Credit Suisse's global head of tax and finance change, will take over as Credit Suisse CFO. Grimwood has been managing integration planning since March, the bank said. Former Credit Suisse Co-head of Markets Michael Ebert will become head of the Credit Suisse investment bank and head of Americas at UBS investment bank, while Jake Scrivens will replace Markus Diethelm as general counsel. Credit Suisse Global Head of Operations Isabelle Hennebelle joins the board in her existing role as head of operations. Asked whether he was concerned about an exodus of talent, Ermotti told CNBC: ""We are always sorry to see talented people leaving, in other cases people were anticipating probably the inevitable restructuring that we will need to go through and decided to go."" He added that the bank had managed to attract external talent after the acquisition announcement. Ermotti's own return to the UBS top job was confirmed in March shortly after the takeover announcement to oversee the transition. He previously led the company from November 2011 to October 2020, managing the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis and a $2.3 billion loss stemming from a rogue trader in London. UBS Chair Colm Kelleher said he ""transformed"" the bank through cost cutting and implementing cultural changes. The $3.2 billion takeover was the tumultuous conclusion of a frantic weekend in March, when worries that severe losses at Credit Suisse would destabilize the banking system drew the key involvement of Swiss regulators. Sweetening the deal, the Swiss government has agreed to cover losses of up to 9 billion Swiss francs ($10 billion) after UBS incurs the first 5 billion Swiss francs as part of the transaction, as the bank absorbs a portfolio that does not entirely ""fit its business and risk profile."" The takeover, which follows multiple scandals and years of share price decline at Credit Suisse, controversially wiped out the 16 billion Swiss francs ($17 billion) worth of assets of the bank's AT1 bond holders. Beat Wittmann, co-founder and partner at Porta Advisors, said the speed with which UBS had managed the takeover was positive for the bank. Going forward will be ""certainly a challenge … but UBS, due to the emergency operation and the collective failure of policymakers and of course of Credit Suisse, got over a weekend an extraordinarily advantageous deal,"" Wittmann told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"". ""There's so much margin of safety in terms of price, in terms of credit lines, in terms of risk sharing with the government, that this is a great deal indeed."" Wittmann said that UBS faces several key challenges, the first of which is the physical integration of the two banking juggernauts and merging of their operating models. Citing a Financial Times report published over the weekend — which CNBC has not confirmed — that UBS had set ""red lines"" for Credit Suisse bankers including bans on new clients from high-risk countries and on launching new products without the approval of UBS managers, Wittmann said ""that's exactly what a bank should do in any case."" Addressing the report, Ermotti told CNBC: ""We have developed that 'red line', which I wouldn't really call a 'red line', over the course of years. This is simply what I mentioned before, we are introducing our processes, our operating model, into Credit Suisse. It's not meant to be discriminatory."" As for further challenges, Wittman drew attention to an upcoming parliamentary inquiry into the Credit Suisse takeover and wider banking stability. Swiss elections could also lead to ""populist demands,"" he stressed, as jobs are cut and branches close around Switzerland. A final trial is the broader macro environment, Wittman said, given the current credit crunch and likely financial market volatility resulting from higher interest rates.",2023-06-12 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/12/ubs-says-it-has-completed-the-takeover-of-credit-suisse.html?&qsearchterm=,18,1008
