Credit Suisse tells clients to sell into a 5% stock rally it sees coming,"Credit Suisse strategists see a near-term stock market rally but are advising investors to sell into the strength.Reduced corporate profit expectations, high corporate debt and the Fed's balance sheet reduction are three factors that could limit upside. The firm does not see a recession likely though it is worried about a slowdown in China's economy.","Global stocks are likely to rise in the near term and investors should be selling into that strength, according to Credit Suisse strategists. Reduced corporate profit expectations, tightening financial conditions due to Federal Reserve actions and elevated levels of corporate debt are three of the principal factors conspiring to limit market upside, the bank said in a research note. Weakness in China and an overall inability for central banks to respond also are compounding the challenge. To be sure, Credit Suisse does not see conditions ripe for a bear market and is in fact forecasting a further boost in equities on top of the solid rally that has kicked off 2019. But it anticipates that the market obstacles will make further increases tough to come by. ""We stick to the year-end targets ... which currently point to around 5% upside for the key global markets, but advise selling developed markets into the rally rather than continuing to build positions,"" analyst Andrew Garthwaite and others said in the report. On the positive side, Garthwaite said a recession is unlikely, valuations are attractive particularly outside the U.S., and central bank pauses in rate hikes, like the one the market expects from the Fed, typically coincide with market gains. The slowdown in corporate earnings, after a year in which U.S. companies posted 20 percent gains, is one obstacle. This year is likely to see that earnings pace domestically drop to 6.9 percent, according to FactSet. ""Global earnings revisions are now negative and correlate very closely to moves in equities,"" Garthwaite wrote. ""At this level, they are now consistent with falling equities over the next year."" The note also cited a slowdown in money supply that is consistent with declines. Specifically, the Federal Reserve's four rate hikes in 2018, combined with the reduction of the bond portfolio on its balance sheet, have caused the money supply to slow. ""We would also stress that the contraction in the Fed balance sheet is unprecedented and, although correlation is not causation, that such a contraction has historically been problematic,"" Garthwaite said. The firm also sees some problems with China, though it is not advising clients to ditch investments in the country. Chinese growth is on pace to post its slowest level since 2009, and the country finds itself locked in a bitter trade dispute with the U.S. that has featured tit-for-tat tariffs that has slowed the movement of goods from the world's second-largest economy. ""China is the biggest macro risk globally. Our bottom line is that we see demand growth slowing further, with some destocking likely, and have yet to see the policy response to cause [Purchase Manager Indexes] to stabilize. We would stress, though, that we do not believe China has run out of policy flexibility, and do not see the preconditions in place for a hard landing,"" the analysts wrote. Credit Suisse joins a number of other forecasters tempering expectations for this year. J.P. Morgan this week lowered its S&P 500 price target from 3,100 to 3,000.

Analyst Stephen Ju also increased his 12-month price forecast for shares of Grubhub to $130 from $125, representing more than 60 percent upside from Friday's closing price of $80.77. ""We have taken steps to extensively recalibrate our model and revisit the key tenets of our investment thesis,"" Ju wrote in a note to clients. We have ""increased comfort around return on invested capital on recent initiatives, which we believe are accretive, opportunistic, and conducted from a position of strength. And we would use any potential pullback to either increase or initiate a position on Grubhub shares."" The stock rose 0.6 percent by 10:45 a.m. ET Monday. The Credit Suisse upgrade comes after a year of intense investment by Grubhub in its delivery network, market expansion and new restaurant chain partnerships. Being able to monitor the acceleration of online order adoption by chain restaurants in an already-competitive environment is key to projecting Grubhub's future earnings, Ju wrote. ""Of the top 100 restaurant chains in the U.S. ... we estimate only 26 have a meaningful presence on Grubhub (as defined by 100+ locations),"" the analyst wrote. ""This implies that in the near-term roughly $14 billion in spend out of a broader $73 billion total addressable market within the base of restaurants that have demonstrated a willingness to utilize Grubhub to generate incremental online demand."" ""Put another way, of the top 20 U.S. restaurant chains — which accounted for $165 billion in total U.S. spend and ~126,000 locations – Grubhub has a meaningful presence with only six chains, which in aggregate represent 26 percent and 37 percent of the spend and locations, respectively,"" he added. Despite any expectations for an increase in future adoption by the nation's largest chains, Ju left his estimate for fourth-quarter sales little changed and just barely bumped higher his adjusted earnings forecast. The analyst expects the food platform to report fourth-quarter earnings per share of 26 cents on Feb. 7, below FactSet's consensus estimates of 28 cents.",2019-01-28 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/28/grubhub-rallies-after-upgrade-tells-clients-to-expect-60percent-upside.html?&qsearchterm=,2,0,358,1.

Credit Suisse swings back to first annual profit since 2014,The bank reported a full-year net profit of 2.1 billion Swiss francs ($ 2.08 billion) for 2018. The Swiss lender reported a net loss of  983 million Swiss francs in 2017.Credit Suisse completed at the end of last year its three-year restructuring program.,"Credit Suisse swung back to profit last year for the first time since 2014, despite some challenging market conditions. The bank reported a full-year net profit of 2.1 billion Swiss francs ($2.08 billion) for 2018. The Swiss lender reported a net loss of 983 million Swiss francs ($975.16 million) in 2017. For its fourth-quarter, the company reported a net income of 292 million Swiss francs. Analysts were expecting a net income of 224.63 million Swiss francs ($222.82 million) according to Reuters. Here are some other details: Credit Suisse completed at the end of last year its three-year restructuring program. Speaking to CNBC after the results, Tidjane Thiam, chief executive officer of Credit Suisse said: ""Having cleaned the balance sheet, dealt with the main legacy issues, (now) it is about to grow and stay close to our clients."" Media reports on Thursday suggested that the Swiss bank could scrap bonuses this year, after losing money in a commodity financing deal in the last quarter of 2018. Thiam told CNBC that although the total of the bonus pool was flat this year, there were fewer employees - meaning that on average people are likely to get a higher compensation. ""On a per capita basis, actually bonuses are up almost everywhere because you have to remember we have fewer people, the total is flat but it actually represents a reasonably strong increase in a per capital basis,"" he said. Credit Suisse highlighted Thursday that there is a lot of uncertainty on the horizon. The bank mentioned that specific concerns over the U.S. government shutdown, U.S.-China trade relations and Brexit had already impacted the start of 2019, with lower fees. ""There is so much uncertainty, the U.S. trade negotiations, Brexit, etc. … the visibility in the next six, nine months is limited,"" Thiam told CNBC.",2019-02-14 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/02/14/credit-suisse-earnings-q4-2018-.html?&qsearchterm=,4,0,301,"1.

Credit Suisse says lighten up on emerging markets stocks after big comeback,"Credit Suisse's Andrew Garthwaite reduces his overweight on emerging markets, citing an expected rebound in China, complacency around U.S.-China trade negotiations and broad optimism in the space.""On our model, we see only 2% outperformance on our base case, but 11% underperformance in the risk scenario,"" Garthwaite says.Still, the strategist maintains his overweight rating as the dollar will likely weaken this year and the ""perfect storm of macro headwinds"" for emerging markets is fading.","Emerging-market stocks are off to a roaring start to the year, but investors might want to take some profits after the big move up, according to Credit Suisse. Andrew Garthwaite, the bank's head of global equity strategy, reduced his overweight rating on emerging markets to 7 percent from 12 percent. He cited several factors, including an expected rebound in China, complacency around U.S.-China trade negotiations and broad optimism in emerging markets. ""On our model, we see only 2% outperformance on our base case, but 11% underperformance in the risk scenario,"" Garthwaite said in a note Wednesday. The iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM) is up 8.6 percent through Tuesday's close. Last year, EEM fell 17.1 percent to notch its biggest annual decline since 2015. Recent data out of China, the largest economy within emerging markets, has been soft. The purchasing managers' index tracking China's services sector has slowed since December, while the index gauging China's key manufacturing sector indicated a contraction to start off 2019. China's economy also grew at its slowest pace in nearly three decades in 2018. This slowdown increased expectations that Chinese authorities will intervene and China's economy will regain its footing. However, ""there has been only a limited policy response so far to turn around growth,"" Garthwaite wrote. He also said a recovery in China is ""largely discounted"" at this point. On the trade front, expectations that China and the U.S. will reach a deal have grown so much that investors are now complacent, Garthwaite said. ""Hence, the market seems vulnerable in the event of a disappointing outcome in the trade negotiations."" Trade negotiations between the two countries are continuing this week in Washington. Both countries have until early March to come up with a deal. Otherwise, additional U.S. tariffs on Chinese goods could be implemented. However, President Donald Trump said Tuesday the March deadline was not a ""magical date."" Lastly, Garthwaite says the long emerging-markets trade may be getting crowded as optimism in the space has surged. An investor survey conducted by Credit Suisse in February showed global emerging markets was the most popular region among investors over a three-month period. Still, the strategist maintains his overweight rating as the dollar will likely weaken this year and the ""perfect storm of macro headwinds"" for emerging markets is fading, saying: In 2018, emerging markets faced a perfect storm of a stronger US dollar, rising TIPS yields, falling China PMIs and the escalating trade war. From here, such a negative combination is unlikely to repeat itself. On our central scenario, there should be no further deterioration in China, the dollar should weaken modestly and the TIPS yield should stay flat.

Credit Suisse on stocks: 'We love China at the moment',"Credit Suisse says the China market is ""going to go up from here.""Some of the factors attributed to the positive sentiment include expectations of a trade deal between Beijing and Washington and signs that China's economy could be stabilizing.","Credit Suisse sees further upside for the Chinese markets, even after shares on the mainland made their largest monthly gain in almost four years in February. ""I think (the) China market is going to go up from here, all the signs are there,"" Suresh Tantia, a senior investment strategist at Credit Suisse's Asia-Pacific CIO Office, told CNBC's ""Capital Connection"" on Friday. ""If you're a global equity fund manager, I think you need to be in China."" Tantia said there were a number of reasons behind his positive take on China. One such factor was optimism over the state of the ongoing U.S.-China trade negotiations, he said: ""There have been signs that, most likely, we will see some sort of deal taking place in the next few months."" Furthermore, he added, China's economy appears to be stabilizing despite the weak February manufacturing numbers from the country. Acknowledging that Friday's release of a private survey indicated China's manufacturing sector contracted, the Credit Suisse strategist said domestic demand appeared ""very strong."" The Caixin/Markit Manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) came in at 49.9 for February — higher than January's reading of 48.3, and better than the 48.5 that economists polled by Reuters had forecast. Still, a reading below 50.0 indicates a contraction in activity. ""It was the export number which led to the weakness in the PMI numbers,"" Tantia said. Still, taking multiple factors into consideration, he added, the data showed that the recent course of fiscal and monetary stimulus from the Chinese government is ""actually working."" ""We love China at the moment,"" Tantia said. ""They said pigs don't fly, but I think they do when it's their time, and this is the Year of the Pig,"" he said, in reference to the zodiac animal which represents the current Chinese lunar year.

Shanghai stocks are set to jump another 10 percent in wake of Chinese stimulus: Credit Suisse,"China's benchmark Shanghai Composite Index could rise another 10 percent after the government announced stimulus measures including tax cuts and infrastructure spending, John Woods, chief investment office for Asia Pacific at Credit Suisse, told CNBC.Chinese Premier Li Keqiang on Tuesday announced stimulus measures, including infrastructure spending and cuts in taxes and fees worth nearly $300 billion as the country lowered its economic growth target range.Domestic industries in China will be the ""biggest beneficiary"" from the stimulus, though regional economies also stand to gain, he said.","China's benchmark stock index could rise another 10 percent on the back of ""market positive"" Chinese policy announcements, John Woods, chief investment officer for Asia Pacific at Credit Suisse, said Wednesday. Woods' comments to CNBC came in reaction to Chinese Premier Li Keqiang's speech Tuesday at the National People's Congress, China's legislature. Li highlighted risks threatening the world's second-largest economy as the government lowered its economic growth target range to between 6 percent and 6.5 percent. In response, Li unveiled stimulus measures, including infrastructure spending and cuts in taxes and fees worth nearly 2 trillion yuan ($289.28 billion). Those included cuts in the value-added tax rate for manufacturing, transportation and construction. ""We took the decisions as being market positive,"" said Woods. ""We think that the focus on infrastructure clearly lends itself to those commodities and equities which are in that space and we think will perform well."" He added that the VAT reductions will have a positive impact on a host of sectors, including consumer staples, consumer discretionary, materials and industrials and energy. ""Those are the sectors which our analysis suggests will benefit with an uptick in earnings growth of between 2 and 3 percent, which is meaningful, which is substantial,"" Woods said. ""So more broadly, the Shanghai composite I think's got another 10 percent upside before I start to take profit,"" he said. ""But, of course, if the retail investor starts to engage, it could move substantially higher."" Woods added that he was impressed that the legislature was focused on the private sector: ""To me, that's the main takeaway,"" he said. Shanghai stocks have been on a tear this year, gaining more than 22 percent through Tuesday. That came after a slump in excess of 24 percent in 2018, the worst performance in a decade, on concerns about China's slowing economy and the trade war with the United States. Speaking earlier on CNBC's ""Squawk Box,"" Woods said Credit Suisse has turned neutral on global equities overall, but it remains overweight on China. Woods added that other regions and economies — namely Southeast Asia, South Korea and Taiwan — can benefit from Li's announced measures to boost the world's second-largest economy. ""But by far the biggest beneficiary will be the domestic industries in China,"" Woods said. ""And this is among the reasons why we remain overweight this market."" In terms of risks to the scenario, Woods cited the possibility of a breakdown in trade talks between the United States and China and that the latter's economy slowing more than expected. But  he said he is optimistic of at least a ""reasonably positive outcome"" for the ongoing trade war, adding that if the two sides can agree to reduce or eliminate imposed tariffs then investors will react positively. ""That could prove another boost to the market,"" he said. And on China's growth, which Credit Suisse is forecasting at 6.2 percent, there is also the possibility it will have to be revised higher, he said. ""I think with the VAT cut, frankly, the risk is to the upside in terms of our GDP growth outlook,"" Woods said.",2019-03-06 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/06/shanghai-stocks-have-another-10-percent-upside-credit-suisse.html?&qsearchterm=,3,0,515,"1.

"Credit Suisse raises S&P 500 forecast, sees 20% gain for 2019","Credit Suisse raised its year-end forecast for the S&P 500 to 3,025 from 2,925.The bank's chief U.S. equity strategist, Jonathan Golub, said the ""receding"" risks will drive the market higher.""Less hawkish comments from the Fed, declining inflation and recession fears, and the potential for a resolution to China trade issues are the primary forces driving volatility and spreads lower, and stocks higher,"" Golub said.","Underneath the stock market's epic rebound has been a ""more favorable"" trend that Credit Suisse says will drive the market higher. The bank dialed up its year-end forecast for  to 3,025 from 2,925 previously. The new outlook calls for a gain of more than 20 percent for full-year 2019 or more than 7 percent from current levels after the big rally to start the year. It would also be the stock market's best year since 2013. That is because all the market risks that tanked stocks in December are now ""receding,"" according to Credit Suisse's chief U.S. equity strategist, Jonathan Golub. ""Investors might be pleased with the market's recent performance, but it's unlikely they find the underlying dynamics—a more favorable risk backdrop, with decelerating economic and earnings growth—particularly inspiring,"" Golub said. ""More specifically, less hawkish comments from the Fed, declining inflation and recession fears, and the potential for a resolution to China trade issues are the primary forces driving volatility and spreads lower, and stocks higher,"" he added.  The market has staged a strong comeback with the S&P 500 up 20 percent from its Christmas Eve low when it dipped into a bear market on an intraday basis. Many have credited the massive sell-off to fears of a too-aggressive Federal Reserve and a possible recession. Now with the central bank signaling a ""patient"" approach to tightening and better-than-expected economic data, the rally may have more room to run. The average S&P 500 target from the 17 top Wall Street analysts is 2,947, a CNBC analysis shows. Credit Suisse actually lowered its 2019 earnings estimates for S&P 500 companies to $170 from $174 despite raising its stock price outlook. The firm says the reduced estimates are due to lower oil prices and large tech companies' worsening outlooks. ""We are lowering our estimates solely to reflect the decline in projections for the energy sector and Apple,"" Golub said. Credit Suisse's new estimates represent an earnings growth rate of 4.4 percent in 2019, versus the Street's consensus of 3.8 percent growth this year, according to FactSet. With the Fed on hold and a trade deal in sight, that should be enough to lift the market despite the weaker earnings outlook. The bank also noted low bond yields are implying a ""much higher"" market multiple. The forward price-earnings ratio for the S&P 500 is currently at 16.4 times, while the low rates are pointing to 20.4 times, the bank said. ""Our work indicates that investors have not fully re-risked portfolios following 4Q's turbulence—despite a sharp decline in volatility and spreads—and that valuations will drift higher as they do so,"" Golub said.",2019-03-18 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/03/18/credit-suisse-raises-sp-500-forecast-sees-20percent-gain-for-2019.html?&qsearchterm=,4,0,437,"1.

India's elections outcome will not have a major impact on its markets: Credit Suisse,"The Indian market is unlikely to suffer from the outcome of India's parliamentary elections starting next month, according to Neelkanth Mishra, co-head of equity strategy for Asia Pacific at Credit Suisse.Mishra said historical performances of major Indian indexes, Sensex and Nifty 50, during the last six elections indicate the polls have had little impact on the market.Even if Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party is unable to win as many seats as the opinion polls are predicting, the big worry among investors is the emergence of a so-called ""third government"" where neither the BJP nor the Indian National Congress holds a major sway.","The Indian market is unlikely to suffer no matter the outcome of India's parliamentary elections, which is starting next month, according to a  Credit Suisse strategist. Historical performances of major Indian indexes, Sensex and Nifty 50, around the last six elections indicate the polls have had little impact on the market, Neelkanth Mishra, co-head of equity strategy for Asia Pacific, said on Wednesday. ""My view is that elections don't affect markets — not the Indian markets,"" he told CNBC's Nancy Hungerford at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong. ""There will be some volatility, perhaps. Whatever the market does, I would act opposite that. If there's a panic selloff, I would buy. If there's a big surge, I would sell."" India will hold elections in seven phases starting from April 11 for the lower house of the parliament. Results are set to be announced in May and a new government will be formed subsequently. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's ruling party alliance — the National Democratic Alliance — is expected to take a majority of the 543 parliamentary seats up for grabs during the elections, according to some opinion polls. The Pew Research Center earlier this week said a survey conducted among 2,521 respondents in India between May and July last year indicated that most adults there are satisfied with the direction of the country as well as economic prospects of the next generation. Still, concerns around national issues such as the lack of employment opportunities as well as the real impact of demonetization and the good and services tax — two major initiatives under the Modi government — persist.  Mishra added that opinion polls in India have been massively inaccurate in the past — and that inaccuracy has been rising. In 2014, polls missed the outcome by as many as 100 seats, he added. Even if Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party is unable to win as many seats as the opinion polls are predicting, the big worry among investors is the emergence of a so-called ""third-front government"" where neither the BJP nor the Indian National Congress holds a major sway. ""That creates chaos, uncertainty and instability in the government and people generally don't like that,"" he said. As far as investments in the Indian markets go, Mishra said the banking sector is becoming an attractive opportunity due to the stress the non-banking finance companies are currently facing. That means banks, a key source of funding for Indian companies, will drive all of the credit growth in the country going forward, he explained.

Credit Suisse's chief economist says he's worried about US inflation shooting up,"Inflation in the U.S. could be ""surprisingly high"" if growth globally holds up after the Federal Reserve's recent decision to stop raising interest rates, James Sweeney, Credit Suisse's chief economist.There were signs that inflation in the U.S. was picking up in certain segments within the services industry even before the Fed's latest moves, Sweeney said.","Inflation in the U.S. could climb to ""surprisingly high"" levels in the next two years if global growth holds up after the Federal Reserve stops raising interest rates, according to Credit Suisse. The Swiss bank's chief economist, James Sweeney, predicted that U.S. inflation could hit 2.2 percent to 2.3 percent by 2020. The latest figures by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics showed that the consumer price index increased by 1.5 percent from a year ago in February. The Fed last week kept interest rates unchanged and indicated that it may not raise rates at all this year. The central bank also lowered its forecast for U.S. economic growth and inflation, citing concerns about weaker Chinese and European economies. But there's a chance that the U.S. economy — the largest in the world — could weather those risks, Sweeney told CNBC's Nancy Hungerford on Thursday at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong. ""This further stimulus by the Fed — if global growth picks up and the U.S. is okay — is likely to lead to some surprisingly high inflation numbers,"" he said. Sweeney added that there were signs that inflation in the U.S. was picking up in certain segments within the services industry, even though overall increase in consumer prices remain below the Fed's 2 percent target. Such a development could push the Fed to resume interest rate hikes, which will hurt markets and the economy if investors are caught off guard, the economist explained. ""The combination of margin erosion for businesses, through rising wage cost, and the potential abrupt tightening of financial conditions at some point, if inflation is rising, is actually a big threat,"" he said. ""I would argue a larger threat than the manufacturing noise that we had just behind us."" Manufacturing activities in major economies such as the U.S., China and Germany have slowed down in recent months.

Trade talks are a bigger risk to Asia markets than the Fed: Credit Suisse,"The U.S. Federal Reserve has captured a lot of attention over the past week, but the trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing that will have a greater impact on stock markets in Asia, said Neil Hosie, Credit Suisse's head of equities for Asia Pacific, speaking to CNBC at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference.Negotiators from the U.S. and China are scheduled to meet in Beijing for their next round of talks starting Thursday.","While the U.S. Federal Reserve has captured a lot of investors' attention over the past week, it is the trade negotiations between Washington and Beijing that will have a greater impact on stock markets in Asia, Credit Suisse said on Thursday. The Fed last week decided to hold interest rates steady — potentially for the rest of this year — and lowered its growth forecast for the U.S. economy. The central bank's moves were followed by an inversion in the U.S. Treasury yield curve, which is seen as an early indicator of a recession. ""I think the impact of the Fed on the markets currently in Asia is going to be significantly less than the talks that are happening now in Beijing,"" Neil Hosie, Credit Suisse's head of equities for Asia Pacific, told CNBC's Nancy Hungerford at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong. Negotiators from the U.S. and China are scheduled to meet in Beijing for their next round of talks starting Thursday. After that, both sides are expected to hold meetings in Washington starting April 3. The two largest economies in the world are negotiating a trade deal after a tariff fight that started last year. Chinese stocks have been the best performer in Asia this year after a battered 2018. The Shanghai composite jumped 21.21 percent so far this year, while the Shenzhen component rose 30.51 percent. The improvement was partly due to investor optimism that tensions between the U.S. and China would not become worse, said Hosie. ""The rally that we've seen in Chinese equities year to date is partially because of the optimism around getting a good outcome (on trade) but it's also valuation-led,"" he said, adding that Chinese stocks were trading ""well below their historical valuation,"" which made them attractive.

"Looking for recession signs? Follow the jobs, says Credit Suisse economist","Investors worried about when the next recession will hit should pay close attention to the overall labor market for clues, said Credit Suisse Chief Economist James Sweeney.Traditional harbingers such as yield curve inversions and weak manufacturing are less important now, given changes to the structure of the labor market that are helping keep unemployment low, he said at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference.","HONG KONG — Investors trying to sniff out signs of the next recession should pay attention to any increase in unemployment rather than movements in bond yield curves and manufacturing, says Credit Suisse Chief Economist James Sweeney. The question of when the next downturn will hit is always worrisome. Recent movements in the U.S. bond market in the form of an inverted yield curve — which occurs when short-term rates surpass longer-term yields — drew a lot of attention, as it's often seen as a recession warning. The weakness in global manufacturing has also raised concerns. Still, Sweeney says those are not currently compelling reasons to be alarmed. The overall labor market is what investors want to watch, he said Thursday during a presentation at the Credit Suisse Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong. ""That's not such a lead indicator for recessions anymore, in my view,"" said the economist, referring to the inverted yield curve and manufacturing data. He said that developed economies are racking up their lowest jobless rates since the early 1980s, and manufacturing ups and downs are less important for overall employment given demographic changes. ""There is a great surge in the demand for labor coming from the personal care industries, health care industry, basically the demand for human attention by aging people,"" he said. ""And it's very clear in the data that these sectors are driving substantial labor demand."" Recessions have become far less frequent in the last three or four decades because the ""cyclical part of the labor market"" in the United States is smaller now, he said.

Those companies meet a variety of criteria Buffett often prioritizes when deciding on opting for a total buyout, including high returns on equity, a fair price, minimal debt and strong management. To try to duplicate those qualities to see what he might buy next, Credit Suisse's quantitative team screened a universe of stocks for characteristics like cash flow return, income and leverage. Those qualities are likely good proxies for the way Buffett thinks about investments, the Credit Suisse HOLT team said. The analysts generated 141 potential targets across Wall Street's sectors, ranging from consumer companies like Target to industrials firms like J.B. Hunt Transport and Snap-On. Here's a list of some of the names Credit Suisse thinks Buffett could snap up next. The Credit Suisse analysis comes less than two months after Buffett told shareholders that he's been struggling to deploy Berkshire Hathaway's $112 billion cash hoard thanks to inflated price tags. ""2019 will likely see us again expanding our holdings of marketable equities,"" Buffett said in his letter to Berkshire shareholders. ""We continue, nevertheless, to hope for an elephant-sized acquisition. Even at our ages of 88 and 95 – I'm the young one – that prospect is what causes my heart and Charlie's to beat faster."" Buffett's long history as a successful stock picker includes bets on some of Wall Street's flagship companies, including Apple, Bank of America and Coca-Cola. One dollar invested in Berkshire Hathaway in December 1964 would now be worth more than $10,000; the same dollar invested in the S&P 500 over the same period would now be worth just a few hundred dollars. Buffett never comments on rumors or speculation about what he buys next and he has advised in the past that investors should not attempt this guessing game.

The bank initiated its coverage on the tech giant with a neutral rating, citing a slowdown in smartphone demand and the iPhone business reaching maturation. It expects iPhone sales to decline 12.4% in 2019 after dropping 3.2% in 2018. ""iPhone is in a difficult spot with units >20% below peak as users are holding on to their devices longer than ever (4 years per CSe) and price hikes have likely run their course,"" Credit Suisse's Matt Cabral said in a note to clients. Apple's flagship business took a hit when the company rolled out overpriced iPhones last fall, adding pressure to the already saturated and competitive market. The iPhone maker then lowered its first-quarter guidance, following weaker than expected iPhone sales and a weakening economy in China. The slowdown in China has been a headache for Apple as it continues to lose share to local brands. Apple slashed iPhone prices by 6% in China after revenue in the region fell 27% year over year in the first quarter. Credit Suisse said there might be ""no quick fix"" in sight to turn it all around. ""Beyond macro conditions, we see deeper structural challenges in China and do not expect a meaningful turnaround without a major iPhone refresh, which is unlikely until 5G in CY20,"" said Cabral, the investment bank's director of equity research. Amid the slowing iPhone business, Apple is aiming to shift its focus on services, hoping to monetize the massive user base. The company debuted a slew of new subscription services two weeks ago, including a TV service, gaming bundle, and magazine subscription, but Credit Suisse said the transition can't be done in the blink of an eye.

Credit Suisse posts profit beat following three-year restructuring plan,"The results come after the Swiss bank swung back to profit in 2018 for the first time in four years.Credit Suisse said Wednesday that it saw some positive momentum at the end of the first quarter, which has continued into April.","Credit Suisse produced another rise in net profit for the first quarter of 2019, its first reporting period following the completion of its three-year restructuring plan. The bank reported a net income of 749 million Swiss francs ($733.93 million) for the first quarter of this year, an 8% increase year-on-year. Analyst expectations were pointing to a net income of 692 million Swiss francs, according to a Reuters poll. Here are some of the key highlights of the first quarter: Tidjane Thiam, chief executive officer of Credit Suisse, told CNBC Wednesday that it was a ""good quarter overall, after a very slow and difficult start."" In an earnings statement, the bank said it was operating with a lower risk profile, a stronger capital base and a structurally lower cost base. Thiam reiterated that the bank's model is ""resilient,"" which has allowed it to protect its ""bottom line during periods when markets are challenging."" The performance in the first quarter was particularly driven by the bank's international wealth management unit, which delivered a net revenue of 1.4 billion Swiss francs. On the other hand, the investment banking arm reported lower revenues compared to the fourth quarter, with a total net revenue of 356 million Swiss francs. Shares were up by more 3% in early deals. The Swiss bank reported a return on tangible equity of 8%, which is another key metric for its financial performance. This was slightly lower from the bank's target of 10%. Speaking to CNBC, Thiam said this had happened due to the challenging market conditions. ""How do you get to 10% in an environment like this, as a European bank? We were at 6% last year; 8% is really a huge increase on last year,"" he said, adding that the bank can still achieve 10% this year, if there is a supportive market environment. Credit Suisse began a share buyback program at the start of 2019, with the aim of purchasing 1 billion Swiss francs by the end of 2019. So far the bank has bought 21.3 million shares for 261 million Swiss francs in the first quarter. ""We have been clear, we said we are aiming for about a billion, market conditions permitting — so that's a big caveat, but for the time being we believe that we are on track to deliver (on that),"" Thiam told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche. The bank also said Wednesday that it saw some positive momentum at the end of the first quarter, which has continued into April.

Credit Suisse says global trends will boost these sectors,"Geopolitical and terrorism risks are set to drive more spending in sectors such as defense and cyber security, according to Credit Suisse.One key investment focus of millennials — a group that is ""increasingly influencing"" businesses — is clean energy, and the bank recommends electricity companies that have already started changing their business models to become renewable energy operators.The bank is also bullish on transport infrastructure and 5G operators.","Global trends are changing many facets of business and politics. While some of those, such as protectionism and political tensions, may be hurting economies, there are still ways for investors to come out on top, according to Credit Suisse. In a report issued at the Credit Suisse Global Supertrends Conference last week, the bank's Head of Economics and Research Nannette Hechler, and Daniel Rupli, head of single security research, went into ""the most significant societal changes"" that could result in tangible investment opportunities. Such trends are set to drive more spending in sectors including defense and cyber security. Meanwhile, the ""Millennials tide"" is just beginning, according to the bank, which referred to how people under the age of 30 are ""increasingly influencing businesses and their values."" That means that areas such as clean energy could be an important investment focus, it said. Here are some sectors that Credit Suisse says will be boosted by major trends. Investments in defense, safety and cybersecurity are expected to increase further on mounting threats, such as terrorism and international conflict. ""The danger to public safety from terrorist attacks, a fragile geopolitical situation, or threats from technology are among the key concerns of the public,"" the report said. The geopolitical environment, especially the situation in the Middle East, Syria and China Seas, ""remains tense,"" it added. Other examples highlighting the need for defense and security include Russia announcing it will deploy a hypersonic missile system and a massive data breach at Marriott's Starwood Hotels database. The protection of personal data is ""high on the political agenda,"" and so investments in cybersecurity are likely to be a top priority for governments and corporations, according to the report. ""In addition, given the rapid technological change and interstate strategic competition — which have overtaken terrorism as the primary concern for US national security — defense spending is set to increase further, for instance in areas such as space, Artificial Intelligence, cyber or hypersonic technology,"" the report said. Public pressure on politicians to rely on renewable energy instead of fossil fuels will continue to intensify as climate activism takes off, according to the report. Therefore, government policy is expected to become ""more ambitious"" in setting near- and medium-term renewable energy targets, Credit Suisse said. It says, as a result, this will have a ""profound impact"" on utility companies. It recommends electricity companies that have already started changing their business models to become renewable energy operators. In particular, the bank recommends operators that own large assets that produce electricity from solar and wind, over equipment and technology suppliers for renewable energy projects. Those assets, according to the report, can ""produce reliable and long-term revenue streams without re-occurring input costs."" ""In Europe, investors still seem to underestimate the positive earnings impact that will come from implementing cheaper wind and solar energy into their generation mix,"" the report said, adding that the full future growth potential of any renewable energy infrastructure has not yet been priced in. Credit Suisse is bullish on transport infrastructure operators  such as those of airports, toll ways and railways, saying that such businesses have strong growth ahead. For instance, the publicly listed Airports of Thailand has benefited from strong passenger numbers, which have jumped threefold over the past 10 years. The bank also flagged French construction giant Vinci, pointing out that it is growing further through acquisitions — it had acquired Gatwick Airport in December 2018, and intends to buy Aeroports de Paris. Infrastructure is a theme back in focus for investors this year, said Credit Suisse, pointing out that the G-20 projects that the global infrastructure gap — the shortfall between required infrastructure and expected projects — will widen to $14.8 trillion by 2040. ""A potential trade deal between the U.S. and China would remove a big uncertainty for global infrastructure projects,"" the Credit Suisse report said. With the U.S. Federal Reserve turning dovish and holding off interest rate hikes, it could be good news for companies that have been pressured by higher financing costs for their infrastructure projects, according to the bank. It pointed to the recent gains in the MSCI World infrastructure index, which had shot up 9.97% year-to-date, as of March 29. The index includes sectors such as telecommunications, utilities, airport services and health-care facilities, among others. This year could be when companies finally benefit from the initial launches of 5G technology, Credit Suisse said. South Korea launched 5G commercially at the end of 2018, while the U.S. introduced standards for the ultra-high-speed data network. The next major launches are expected to be in Japan, China and Europe — but not before 2020, according to the bank. Its focus, then, would be on 5G-related infrastructure providers, such as data centers, telephone tower companies and equipment providers for 5G telecommunications assets, it said. For instance, telephone tower companies may generate strong growth from the upcoming 5G implementation. Demand for wider bandwidth will go up, and the transmission distance between towers must shorten, to achieve seamless 5G coverage, Credit Suisse said. As a result, more towers will be acquired or merged to increase the coverage, the bank said, pointing to a recent move by telecommunications companies Telecom Italia and Vodafone Italia to enter into a 5G network sharing agreement.",2019-05-02 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/05/02/investing-credit-suisse-says-global-trends-will-boost-these-sectors.html?&qsearchterm=,9,0,874,"1.

As a framework to value the stock, Credit Suisse took the approach of comparing it to another ""niche"" auto industry incumbent: Volkswagen. Both are betting on a long-term industry shift to electric. But VW is the ""definition of an industry incumbent"" selling more vehicles annually than any other automaker in the world and more than 40x Tesla's volume in 2018, Levy said. Through that lens, Tesla is a ""small newcomer to an industry which has historically had extremely high barriers to entry."" ""The Tesla vs. VW debate could be relevant for the next decade or more,"" he said. ""Both automakers are treating the long-term industry shift to vehicle electrification as an existential matter. Yet they are coming from vastly different positions."" Levy pointed to VW's going ""all in"" on electric cars and commitments to launch 70 new battery electric vehicle cars in the next decade and invest more than $34 billion around vehicle electrification, he said. To be sure though, Levy said Tesla does have some key advantages over legacy automakers including lower battery costs.

"Investors should buy Chinese internet stocks, UBS and Credit Suisse say","Although Chinese internet companies have seen their stocks stumble, two global investment banks say the sector appears to be a solid bet.""Internet is essentially a structural growth story in China. We don't see it changing anytime soon,"" says Credit Suisse Chief Investment Officer for Asia Pacific John Woods.UBS Global Wealth Management says, meanwhile, that Chinese internet companies offered ""solid share buyback prospects"" and have high cash flows."," Chinese internet stocks may be a good buy for investors, according to global investment banks UBS and Credit Suisse. Technology has emerged as a heated battleground in the ongoing U.S.-China trade conflict as both countries seek to dominate new areas like 5G and artificial intelligence. Amid that, Chinese internet companies have seen their stocks stumble. Still, John Woods, Credit Suisse's chief investment officer for Asia Pacific, said the sector appears to be a solid bet. ""Internet is essentially a structural growth story in China. We don't see it changing anytime soon,"" Woods told CNBC on Tuesday. ""It sold off aggressively ... from mid-April. So we feel there's upside in that particular sector."" That assessment was also expressed by UBS Global Wealth Management in a briefing in Singapore on Monday. Tan Min Lan, the head of the Asia Pacific Investment Office at UBS Global Wealth Management, said that Chinese internet companies offered ""solid share buyback prospects"" and have high cash flows. Although Chinese tech companies such as Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba have been exposed to U.S.-China trade tensions, Woods pointed out that they are largely focused on the domestic market. ""Clearly we want to focus on those names and those sectors within that broad group which have a profound domestic focus. Actually, the internet stocks do have an overwhelmingly domestic focus. They are not really export-oriented,"" Woods said. ""They're absolutely focused on consumption plays, services plays within the domestic economy and those are the ones we want to focus on."" UBS' Tan, too, pointed to the domestic focus of those stocks as a strength. ""We still like software and services, and we like internet because the bulk of the revenues is generated domestically,"" she said. The KraneShares CSI China Internet exchange-traded fund, which tracks Chinese tech stocks including Baidu, Tencent and Alibaba, tumbled in May as the U.S and China ratcheted up tariffs on each other's goods, before rebounding slightly beginning in June. Beyond internet companies, Woods highlighted two other sectors in China that are set to perform well: insurance and infrastructure. Infrastructure will ride on the Chinese government's efforts to stimulate the economy, he said. With the slowing domestic growth, Beijing has ramped up fiscal spending, including in infrastructure projects. As for insurance, the sector will tap on the aging trend in China, Woods said. ""It reflects the dramatic aging we're seeing right now in China, the need for insurance, particularly health insurance,"" he told CNBC. — CNBC's Elizabeth Schulze contributed to this report.",2019-07-09 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/07/09/investing-ubs-and-credit-suisse-recommend-chinese-internet-stocks.html?&qsearchterm=,2,0,414,"1.

The firm lowered Amazon's full-year 2019 earnings per share estimate to $38.87 from the previous estimate of $41.14, citing greater shipping costs as Amazon expands its one-day prime offering. ""We lower our operating income forecast for 2H19/2020 as we expect Amazon to underwrite faster Prime shipping across a greater selection of products, with a rationale consistent with past practice – to place greater distance between its consumer value proposition vs its competitors,"" said Credit Suisse research analyst Stephen Ju in a note to clients Wednesday. Last month, Amazon rolled out free one-day shipping for Prime members on over 10 million products. Amazon executives said on its last earnings call that it will spend $800 million in the second quarter of 2019 to shorten the standard shipping program for Prime customers from two days to one. In order to increase global market value, Credit Suisse expects Amazon to apply one-day shipping on a large number of products in the remainder of the year, causing a greater-than-expected hit to margins. Amazon shares fell more than 1% on Wednesday morning but closed the day up 0.32%.   Despite the earnings estimate cut, Credit Suisse slightly raised its price target for Amazon to $2250 from $2200 and maintained its outperform rating on the stock.

Analysts polled by Reuters expected a net profit of 720.3 million Swiss francs ($726.13 million) for the second-quarter of 2019. The Swiss bank had reported a net profit of 647 million Swiss francs for the same period a year ago. Here are some of the key highlights for the quarter: The Swiss-lender surprised analysts on Wednesday by achieving a return on tangible equity (ROTE) of nearly 10% ahead of expectations. ROTE measures the bank's ability to deal with potential losses. The higher the ROTE, the more sound the bank is considered to be. The bank achieved this number for the first time since the restructuring drive taken up in the fourth quarter of 2015. Speaking to CNBC's Carolin Roth, Thiam said: ""We also think we can go much higher on that (ROTE)...and that's a function of particularly the growth in wealth management."" The bank's international wealth management division grew from a year ago. It reported a net income of 444 million Swiss francs for the second quarter of 2019 compared to 433 million Swiss francs a year ago. Credit Suisse said that wealth management ""delivered robust results in the second quarter with stronger asset gathering after the slowdown experienced in the first quarter of the year."" Shares rose almost 3% in early deals.  At the end of last quarter, Tidjane Thiam, chief executive officer of Credit Suisse, told CNBC that there was a cloud of uncertainty over the bank's performance this year. The Swiss-lender cited geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty as a potential risk to client activity. However, Credit Suisse, in its latest report, said that the second quarter saw a ""more supportive environment"" on the back of optimism over Sino-U.S. trade talks and dovish comments from central banks. Both the European Central Bank (ECB) and the U.S. Federal Reserve have signaled that more stimulus is needed to boost their respective economies. Market expectations point to a rate cut in the United States Wednesday, when the Federal Reserve announces its latest policy decisions. There's also a market consensus that the ECB will cut rates at its next meeting in mid-September. Both central banks have recently tried to reduce their stimulus to their economies since the sovereign debt crisis, but economic data is still showing weaknesses. Speaking to CNBC, Thiam said: ""I am not a great fan of low interest rates, as a great a believer in the importance of savings in the economy. Subsidies to debtors and penalties for savers, I think in the long term harms the economy."" Low interest rates stimulate borrowing. Looking ahead to third quarter results, Credit Suisse said that so far there have been ""healthy levels"" of client engagement, but it remains to be seen ""whether this translates into activity"".

He told clients in a note Thursday to expect a ""wave of lowered guidance"" as Macy's, J.C. Penney, Nordstrom and Kohl's start to report fiscal second-quarter earnings next week. While these retailers appear to have tightened their inventories during the second quarter, which should help reduce pressure on gross margins, Binetti predicts these companies will have lower sales and earnings targets for the second half of the year, with waning foot traffic at stores hurting the group. To top it off, these retailers now face the 10% tariffs set to go into effect on Sept. 1, which will hit apparel and footwear, among other consumer goods. ""Department store cost structures will be even more pressure[d] than expected in the near term,"" he said. Credit Suisse is lowering its profit estimates for some of the department store stocks. It now expects Macy's will report second-quarter earnings per share of 49 cents, down from 51 cents. It lowered its second-quarter earnings outlook for Nordstrom to 70 cents a share, from 76 cents. For Kohl's, the firm is still calling for earnings per share of $1.55. And for Penney, it forecasts a second-quarter loss of 35 cents. Consensus estimates in a Refinitiv survey call for Macy's to report second-quarter earnings per share of 46 cents, Nordstrom 78 cents, Kohl's $1.54 and Penney a loss of 31 cents. Credit Suisse also lowered its price target for Nordstrom to $32 from $36 and for Macy's to $24 from $26. Department stores have been hit hard by investors this year. Macy's shares have fallen more than 30% this year to trade around $20; Nordstrom has lost about 35% of its value to around $30; Kohl's shares are down about 24% since January to around $50; and Penney's stock, having tanked more than 33%to under $1, putting it at risk of being delisted from the New York Stock Exchange. The holiday season is typically a time for retailers to shine, with companies relying on the heavier traffic to boost their businesses, which could be sluggish during other parts of the year.

A 'recession dashboard' from Credit Suisse indicates the economy is nowhere near a recession,"Credit Suisse created a ""recession dashboard"" in which the firm tracked the state of certain economic indicators at the start of each recession dating back to 1973.Currently, the yield curve is the only economic indicator pointing to a recession.In past recessions, indicators like inflation trends, job creation, credit performance, ISM manufacturing, earnings quality and the housing market were all recessionary or neutral, while the current state of the economy is telling a different story."," Economic data looks nothing like that of a recession, according to Credit Suisse. The firm created a ""recession dashboard"" in which the firm tracked the state of seven main economic indicators at the start of each recession dating back to 1973. In past recessions, most of the indicators were ""recessionary"" or ""neutral,"" while the current state of the economy is telling a different story. ""Key signals such as labor and credit trends remain quite healthy,"" said Credit Suisse's chief U.S. equity strategist, Jonathan Golub, in a note to clients Tuesday. Last week, the U.S. bond yield curve inverted, a phenomenon that historically presages a recession. That was the only one of the seven major indicators Credit Suisse tracks to signal a downturn. In past recessions, indicators like inflation trends, job creation, credit performance, ISM manufacturing, earnings quality and the housing market were all showing weakness. The labor market is strong with the total labor force hitting a record high of 163.4 million, according to the Labor Department's July jobs report. And credit conditions have not deteriorated to recession levels. Inflation and earnings quality are all ""expansionary"" indicators, according to Golub. Inflation is close to the Federal Reserve's 2% target and in the second quarter, nearly 75% of S&P 500 companies that reported earnings so far beat analyst's expectations. To be sure, despite the recession scorecard looking optimistic, Golub said, ""recessionary indicators are more mixed than they have been since the financial crisis."" Manufacturing data, which is currently ""neutral"" on Golub's dashboard, has deteriorated meaningfully, primarily outside of the U.S., he said. Growth in the U.S. services sectors decelerated in July to its weakest level in three years as trade worries weighed on business orders and the outlook for the overall economy.

At present, he added: ""We don't see any external risk for India."" Tantia pointed to the low price of oil currently, with international benchmark Brent crude futures sitting at the low 60 dollars per barrel level. India, a major crude importer, is especially vulnerable to any increases in oil prices, being heavily reliant on the commodity. More expensive oil would lead to a widening current account deficit for the country. Additionally, India faces ""no political risk"" following Prime Minister Narendra Modi's landslide election victory earlier this year, Tantia said. Meanwhile, the country's central bank is also cutting interest rates and the government is offering ""some sort of fiscal stimulus support."" In late August, the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) central board said it will transfer 1.76 trillion Indian rupees (about $24.6 billion) as dividend to New Delhi for the year that ended on June 30, 2019 — higher than what the market had been expecting. The RBI follows a 12-month period that runs from July to June and pays an annual dividend to the government based on its profits. Last year, the RBI board formed a committee to look into how much the central bank should hold in its reserves amid a push from the government to access the surplus for stimulus packages. India is also a ""defensive market"" that is more domestic oriented, Tantia said, leaving it relatively insulated from the ongoing trade fight between Beijing and Washington — as compared to most of Asia where markets are ""very vulnerable"" to headlines about the dispute.

Credit Suisse hopes to close the curtain on bizarre spying saga,"An internal investigation carried out by law firm Homburger determined that Credit Suisse COO Pierre-Olivier Bouee ordered surveillance of former wealth management boss Iqbal Khan, who left the Swiss lender to join UBS.In a press conference on Tuesday, Credit Suisse Chairman Urs Rohner apologized to Khan and his family for the “wrong and disproportionate” observation operation which has caused “severe reputational damage to the bank.”The events unfolded against the backdrop of a falling out between Khan and CEO Tidjane Thiam, but the investigation cleared Thiam of any involvement in the spying.","Following the eruption of an unprecedented scandal at Credit Suisse over the past month, COO Pierre-Olivier Bouee is out, its CEO Tidjane Thiam is in the clear, and the bank is scrambling to mitigate the ""reputational damage"" inflicted by efforts to carry out covert surveillance on a former top executive. An internal investigation carried out by law firm Homburger determined that Bouee acted alone in ordering surveillance of former wealth management boss Iqbal Khan, who left the Swiss lender abruptly in July to join fierce domestic rival UBS. In a press conference on Tuesday, Credit Suisse Chairman Urs Rohner apologized to Khan and his family for the ""wrong and disproportionate"" observation operation which has caused ""severe reputational damage to the bank."" However, he reiterated the Board's confidence in Thiam, insisting that the investigation found ""zero evidence"" that he was aware of the spying. Asked by CNBC's Geoff Cutmore whether it was credible to believe that Thiam had no knowledge at all of the events, and whether that was a concern in itself, Rohner said this had been discussed when investigators interviewed Thiam. ""We have absolutely zero evidence that he was informed about it, and even in a big company, there are incidents and it was clearly established in the investigation that the COO of the company had acted alone and sometimes it may take some time to actually find out if something like that happened,"" Rohner said. Bouee has been replaced as COO by company veteran James Walker. The directors also confirmed that a security consultant working for the bank had died, and expressed their condolences, but did not comment further. The Wall Street Journal had reported that the individual committed suicide last Tuesday, citing the Zurich lawyer representing private investigation firm Investigo, which carried out the surveillance on Khan. CNBC was not able to independently verify this report. Khan left Credit Suisse in July following a deterioration of his relationship with Thiam, according to ongoing media reports. He was placed on unusually short gardening leave, given his seniority, and it was announced in late August that he was due to start work at UBS on Tuesday, October 1. At Tuesday's press conference, Rohner said he personally negotiated the gardening leave with Khan and without the involvement of Thiam. The chairman revealed that he was informed by both Khan and Thiam in January of a dispute which took place at a ""personal level"" and ""seemed to have been a heated discussion,"" adding that their accounts of the sequence of events had differed. Khan filed a complaint with police in September after reportedly spotting an investigator following him and his wife in Zurich, though conflicting accounts of the incident have emerged. The Homburger investigation has now revealed that Investigo was appointed to monitor whether Khan was trying to poach former colleagues and clients to join him at UBS. It concluded that Bouee alone ordered the bank's head of global security services to initiate observation of Khan. The head of global security services has also resigned. Credit Suisse confirmed that no evidence was found suggesting that Khan was engaging in such activities. Several media outlets, citing sources close to Khan and Thiam, reported in September that the relationship between the pair had broken down partly because of Khan's rising ambitions, and partly due to a neighborly dispute. Khan moved in next door to his boss in a small community by Lake Zurich. The incident in January to which Rohner alluded in the press conference reportedly involved a confrontation at a party at Thiam's house, after Khan raised objections with Thiam's partner about trees on the property, according to the Financial Times and the Wall Street Journal. A summary of the Homburger investigation's findings said no evidence had been found that the surveillance was related to the personal differences between the two men.",2019-10-02 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/01/credit-suisse-hopes-to-close-the-curtain-on-bizarre-spying-saga.html?&qsearchterm=,4,0,640,"-1.

Credit Suisse has a word to describe this sluggish economy — a 'semi-recession',"Credit Suisse says the economy is in a ""semi-recession.""The firm said weak manufacturing data accompanied by healthy economic data elsewhere lands the economy in a middle ground.Credit Suisse's chief U.S. equity strategist, Jonathan Golub, noted that inflation, jobs data and credit performance are all still expansionary for the economy.","Investors and economists are chasing a moving target of strong and weak economic data, making it increasingly confusing what the state of the economy really is. Credit Suisse said weak manufacturing data accompanied by healthy economic data elsewhere lands the economy in a middle ground. ""While investors debate whether we're entering a recession, we believe the backdrop is better described as a 'Semi-Recession,'"" Jonathan Golub,  chief U.S. equity strategist at Credit Suisse, said in a note to clients Wednesday. A gauge of the U.S. manufacturing sector released Tuesday showed the lowest reading in more than a decade for September as exports fell amid the U.S.-China trade war. The ISM U.S. manufacturing purchasing managers' index came in at 47.8% for the month, the lowest since June 2009. Any reading below 50 signals a contraction.  Meanwhile, industrial production has been in a yearlong deceleration, despite a positive reading in August. Manufacturing, which accounts for about 11% of the U.S. economy, is being hurt by the trade war between the United States and China and slowing global economic growth. The 0.6% increase in industrial production in August was the largest gain in industrial output since August 2018 and followed a 0.1% dip in July, according to the Federal Reserve. Alongside weak manufacturing data, the yield curve is inverted on the short end, meaning the 10-year Treasury note has a lower yield than the 3-month Treasury bill. This bond market phenomena is regarded as a recessionary signal. ""Recessionary risks are clearly rising,"" said Golub. ""Absent a reacceleration in cyclical data, stock upside appears limited,"" he said. To be sure, Golub said, ""recessionary indicators have weakened but do not point to a broad-based downturn."" Weak data is offset by a strong labor market, Golub said. September's jobs report, set to be released Friday, is expected to show 148,000 new payrolls and jobless claims continue to decline, he said. Golub noted inflation, jobs data and credit performance are all still expansionary for the economy.

Credit Suisse posts profit beat but warns of 'challenging geopolitical environment',The group posted net income of 881 million Swiss francs ($886.9 million).This was a 108% increase from the 424 million Swiss francs reported for the same period last year. Analysts had expected a figure of 816 million Swiss francs.,"Credit Suisse reported higher-than-expected net income for the third quarter of 2019 on Wednesday. The group posted net income of 881 million Swiss francs ($886.9 million), a 108% increase from the 424 million Swiss francs reported for the same period last year. Analysts polled by Reuters had expected a net income figure of 816 million Swiss francs. Here are the key figures for the third quarter: The group also doubled its return on tangible equity to 9.0% from 4.5% in the third quarter of 2018. Speaking to CNBC Wednesday morning, Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam praised the performance of the group's investment banking and wealth management franchises against a challenging environment. ""Last year, there was a lot of debate on whether we had restructured enough or we should do more restructuring, and we said 'no, we have a good platform, now we need to give them a chance to show what they can do' and the results have been really, really excellent."" In its outlook, the group said it expects headwinds from the ""ongoing challenging geopolitical environment"" to persist into the final quarter of the year, most notably Brexit and the U.S.-China trade dispute. ""This is likely to lead to more cautious capital expenditure and investment decisions,"" the statement added. Thiam told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche that ""the fundamentals that drive our numbers are healthy."" ""The wealth management and the diversification of our platform, that continues to work. Now some parts of our activity, particularly look at IBCM (Investment Banking & Capital Markets) which is very difficult this quarter, our primary activity across markets has dropped down, are more challenging and are more market dependent,"" he added. Credit Suisse is emerging from a turbulent quarter after a spying scandal which saw Chief Operating Officer Pierre-Olivier Bouee resign over the botched surveillance of former wealth management head Iqbal Khan. An internal investigation subsequently cleared CEO Tidjane Thiam of any wrongdoing.

Credit Suisse CEO reads out a letter from the family of a contractor who committed suicide,An internal investigation into the spying saga which erupted in September cleared Thiam of any knowledge or involvement in the surveillance of former wealth management boss Iqbal Khan.Reports then emerged in early October that a private investigator who organized the surveillance mission had committed suicide.,"Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam on Wednesday read out a letter from the family of a contractor who committed suicide in the wake of a spying scandal which rocked the Swiss lender. An internal investigation into the saga which erupted in September cleared Thiam of any knowledge or involvement in the surveillance of former wealth management boss Iqbal Khan, who has since joined fierce rival UBS, following the announcement that he was leaving the bank in July. The probe by law firm Homburger determined that COO Pierre-Olivier Bouee acted alone in ordering private investigators Investigo to track Khan's movements and establish whether he was trying to poach former colleagues and clients. Bouee and Credit Suisse's head of global security services subsequently resigned. Reports also emerged that a private investigator who organized the surveillance mission had committed suicide. Reuters reported that the investigator worked as a middleman between Switzerland's second-largest bank and the private security firm. Speaking to CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche following Credit Suisse's third-quarter earnings report Wednesday, Thiam read out a letter from the family of the contractor and expressed the bank's sadness and regret, adding that this event was ""what led to the resignation of individuals."" The letter stated: ""We do not know with absolute certainty what led him to believe he had no option but to take his own life. There are no guilty parties. He was an honest individual with a sense of integrity, and he is being mourned by those who loved him. We therefore ask that our privacy be respected at this difficult time."" Thiam staunchly denied ordering the surveillance of Khan, calling the action ""inappropriate and disproportionate,"" but maintained that the departed COO Bouee had believed he was ""acting in the best interests of the bank."" ""There was concern about his departure, I was involved in putting in best retention measures. I spent a lot of time with the people who were at risk and were still in the bank, but that decision was not made by me,"" he added. Asked how he was unaware of the drastic action ordered by such a senior member of his team, Thiam blamed a lack of policy for handling such unprecedented events. ""I will maintain that everything we have seen since then means that he thought he was acting in the best interest of the bank,"" he said. ""Part of the issue is that we don't have a policy to do with those types of things because we don't customarily do those types of things. It was a unique case, so there were no procedures or policies established to handle it."" Thiam has remained publicly silent on the scandal throughout the course of the investigation and beyond, but said the issue had been discussed with staff, going on to thank them for having ""stayed focused."" He also thanked Credit Suisse clients, whom he said had ""really stuck with the bank"" throughout the saga.",2019-10-30 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/10/30/credit-suisse-ceo-letter-from-contractors-family-who-committed-suicide.html?&qsearchterm=,4,0,486,"-1.

Credit Suisse is 'very positive' about China's long-term growth,"Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam sees opportunities in China as its economy shifts to a consumer-driven one — making it ""less sensitive"" to trade.""There is ... a shift of the Chinese model from a manufacturing, export-oriented model, to a more consumer-oriented, domestic-based economy, that will also be less sensitive to issues like trade,"" Thiam says.He says the financial sector has a major role to play in transforming China's economy.","Credit Suisse CEO Tidjane Thiam is bullish on China, and sees opportunities as its economy shifts to a consumer-driven one — making it ""less sensitive"" to trade. ""We have very positive expectations about China long term,"" he said at the Credit Suisse China Investment Conference in Shenzhen on Wednesday. ""We believe that the fundamentals that have been driving China's growth for so many years are intact."" ""There is ... a shift of the Chinese model from a manufacturing, export-oriented model, to a more consumer-oriented, domestic-based economy, that will also be less sensitive to issues like trade,"" Thiam added, flagging healthcare and technology as two sectors he believes in. China is currently embroiled in a trade dispute with the U.S., which has led to both sides imposing tariffs on billions of dollars worth of each other's goods. The world's two biggest economies are currently trying to reach a 'phase one' trade deal, which has yet to be signed. Amid those trade tensions, tariffs have hit China's exports and its economy has increasingly declined, with the country reporting that third-quarter GDP grew by a slower-than-expected 6%. Its GDP has fallen sharply since the first quarter of 2018, when the trade war began. Still, analysts have pointed out that those trade concerns are overrated. They say China's burgeoning domestic economy contributes more to growth than its exports. In recent months, Beijing has also unveiled measures to boost consumption, which include extending retail hours to help lift China's ""night economy."" The financial sector has a ""key role"" to play in transforming China's economy, Thiam said. ""Take pensions for example ... huge opportunity. As (the) social safety net develops, as the population ages, the assets in the pension sector are going to grow very strongly,"" he said, adding that Credit Suisse is in the ""biggest"" asset management joint venture in the country with state-owned Chinese bank ICBC. ""We feel that the patience and the belief that we've had in the Chinese economy is being rewarded. The upside is huge ... We are investing and will continue to invest for the long term to support the Chinese economy,"" he said. Beijing has said it wants to open up its financial sector to more foreign investment, and allow foreign companies to compete on an equal footing with its domestic firms. Last year, Chinese A-shares — yuan-denominated stocks traded on mainland China — were included in the MSCI Emerging Markets Index. MSCI quadrupled the weighting of A-shares this year. Also this year, Chinese bonds were included in the widely followed Bloomberg Barclays index. Those developments are expected to bring billions of dollars worth of fresh foreign inflows into the Chinese economy.",2019-11-06 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/06/credit-suisse-ceo-is-bullish-on-chinas-domestic-economy.html?&qsearchterm=,3,0,443,1.

Credit Suisse says Tesla is running out of time as the major electric car maker – shares to dive 40%,"""For all the competition entering the market we are still awaiting the EV that will be a true competitive threat to Model 3 – especially in the US,"" Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy says.Despite the bullish statement, Credit Suisse remains one of Tesla's skeptics, with an underweight rating on the stock, and that's in part because of Ford.""Ford's new [electric vehicle] should provide a more compelling alternative at the Model 3 price range than the other comps, especially given the performance focus,"" Levy said.","Credit Suisse on Thursday noted that Tesla has nearly an 80% share of the U.S. market for electric vehicles but the firm expects that the automaker's ""unique position"" with its Model 3 will face a serious challenge from Ford next year. ""For all the competition entering the market we are still awaiting the EV that will be a true competitive threat to Model 3 – especially in the US,"" Credit Suisse analyst Dan Levy wrote in a note to investors. ""Tesla has a window of opportunity now with a clear competitive lead."" While a statement like this may be common among Wall Street's bullish Tesla analysts, Credit Suisse remains one of the company's skeptics. Credit Suisse has had an underweight rating on Tesla shares since the firm began covering the stock in June, with a $200 price target. That's more than 40% below the stock's close on Wednesday at $346.11 a share. ""Yet to the extent Tesla continues to struggle with the basic 'blocking and tackling' of the auto business (i.e., manufacturing, delivery logistics, service), it risks not capitalizing on this opportunity,"" Levy said. He believes Tesla will soon face a key test as ""the only game in town,"" as Ford is expected to announce the Mach-E on Sunday, a line of a Mustang-inspired electric SUVs. ""The launch marks the first real milestone in Ford's increased emphasis in electrification, and more importantly marks an increased effort by the legacy US automakers to be relevant in electrification,"" Levy said. Ford's Mach-E will be available in the U.S, Canada and Europe next fall. Credit Suisse estimates the Mach-E will be priced ""in the mass luxury range"" between $40,000 and $50,000, with an expected 300-mile range.

"Credit Suisse sets 2020 S&P 500 target, sees another banner year led by tech and banks","Credit Suisse Chief U.S. equity strategist Jonathan Golub says the broad market index should rally nearly 10% from current levels by the end of 2020.""These estimates imply EPS growth of 5.2% next year, a substantial improvement from 2019's 1.0% expected increase,"" Golub says in a note to clients.His outlook is based on expectations of better revenue growth, reduced profit headwinds, frequent buybacks and a reversal of slowing economic data.","The historic bull market that has kept stocks afloat for more than a decade will continue at least through 2020 as profit headwinds subside and share buybacks remain ""abundant,"" Credit Suisse told clients on Monday. In his 2020 outlook, Chief U.S. equity strategist Jonathan Golub said the softer economic data that marked much of this year should improve in 2020 and put the S&P 500 on track to finish next year at 3,425, a 9.8% climb from Friday's close. He based his S&P target on an earnings-per-share estimate of $164.50 in 2019 and $173 in 2020. ""These estimates imply EPS growth of 5.2% next year, a substantial improvement from 2019's 1.0% expected increase,"" Golub wrote in a note to clients. ""We are upgrading more economically-sensitive groups including Financials, Industrials, Materials, and Energy. We are downgrading more defensive sectors including Staples, Utilities, REITs, and Communications."" Credit Suisse is overweight technology, consumer discretionary, financials, industrials and materials stocks. It is underweight staples, utilities and REITs. Golub said better economic data should benefit groups that underperformed in late summer like financials, industrials and materials. ""Economic data has decelerated over the past 1+ years, resulting in the outperformance of Low Vol and Growth stocks, at the expense of Value,"" he wrote. ""This leadership shifted more recently, on aggressive Fed action (3 cuts) and improving economics. Our work indicates that this rotation will continue through the early part of 2020."" Key to the investment bank's more optimistic outlook are four tenets: Golub's first S&P 500 target for 2019 more than one year ago was 3,350. At the time in September 2018, that target implied not only a 12.2% rally through the end of last year to his 3,000 projection, but an additional 11.7% climb in 2019. A dramatic spike in volatility later in 2018 and a Christmastime sell-off, however, forced Golub to temper his expectations to a far more modest 2,925 for 2019. The market index finished 2018 just above 2,500 and ended last week at 3,120.46, a 24% rally year to date.  Though it's still early and several top strategists have yet to publish their own 2020 estimates, Golub is the most bullish on 2020 of those tracked by CNBC. The median 2020 estimate is 3,350 while the average is 3,235, based on the first five targets.",2019-11-18 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/18/credit-suisse-sets-2020-sp-500-target-says-stocks-to-jump-10percent.html?&qsearchterm=,2,0,383,1.

Credit Suisse says to buy Virgin Galactic stock for its 'near-term monopoly' on space tourism,"""Our bullish view reflects the near-term monopoly SPCE offers in an industry (commercial space tourism) where public investment opportunities are scarce,"" Credit Suisse says.At $250,000 per person, Virgin Galactic's ticket revenue is about three times the cost of each flight, Credit Suisse says.Credit Suisse is the second firm to begin covering Virgin Galactic with a bullish rating on the stock.","Credit Suisse began coverage of Virgin Galactic with an outperform rating Thursday, saying in an a note titled ""The Ultimate Joyride"" that the firm sees multiple factors driving the space tourism stock higher. ""Our bullish view reflects the near-term monopoly SPCE offers in an industry (commercial space tourism) where public investment opportunities are scarce. We view this as a classic tech-driven high demand, low supply story with high barriers to entry,"" Credit Suisse analyst Robert Spingarn wrote in a note to investors. ""Not everyone will see the value, but we believe the math works nonetheless."" Virgin Galactic shares rose in premarket but later dropped, closing down 7.4% at $9.10. Credit Suisse has a $12.43 price target on the stock, essentially seeing 36% upside over the next year. The firm is the second to begin covering Virgin Galactic with a buy recommendation: Vertical Research Partners is also bullish on the opportunity. The stock has slid since its public debut last month, down about 20%, but that doesn't worry Virgin Galactic Chairman Chamath Palihapitiya. He expects Virgin Galactic to begin flying its first customers as early as May, saying on Wednesday that flights ""will begin in about six to nine months."" ""I think the story of Virgin is just so new that it hasn't been written yet. We'll start commercial operations in the middle of next year, so the full-fledged business value will become apparent very quickly to a lot more people at that point,"" Palihapitiya said in an interview with CNBC's Seema Mody on ""Closing Bell."" Credit Suisse agrees, saying the stock's upside largely depends on how closely Virgin Galactic sticks to its schedule and begins flying people. ""We believe the greatest single catalyst would be successful completion of the first commercial flight,"" Spingarn said. ""From here, losses should dissipate rapidly as flight activity rises."" At $250,000 per person, Virgin Galactic's ticket revenue is about three times the cost of each flight, Credit Suisse noted, ""which would drive very attractive incremental margins."" The company's spacecraft holds up to six passengers along with the two pilots. Spingarn says Virgin Galactic ""has a distinct first-to-market advantage"" in space tourism, estimating nearest competitor Blue Origin is at least two years behind. And even when Blue Origin does start flying people, the company is inaccessible to public investors as it is wholly owned and funded by Jeff Bezos. Credit Suisse also mentions SpaceX, with its fully reusable Starship rocket, as a long-term threat to Virgin Galactic's business. ""While SpaceX does not appear to be as focused on space tourism, a point-to-point solution serviced by Starship could convert space travel from a novelty experience to a commodity service,"" Spingarn said. Virgin Galactic is thinking about the potential of high-speed, long distance travel, also known as point-to-point space travel. Boeing's venture arm HorizonX last month invested $20 million into Virgin Galactic to explore developing a vehicle capable of flying around the world at hypersonic speeds. But SpaceX is a notable risk to Virgin Galactic's future business, Credit Suisse said. ""Unless Virgin is able to offer a similarly compelling point-to-point solution, the arrival of point-to-point by competitors could damage the overall [total addressable market] for space tourism and, therefore, the long-term demand profile,"" Spingarn said. Finally, Credit Suisse warns that any major accident or malfunction would likely substantially slow Virgin Galactic's business. In 2014, an accident during a Virgin Galactic test flight killed a co-pilot. ""We assign a $0 value in the case of a catastrophic event (e.g., a fatal crash),"" Spingarn said.",2019-11-21 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/11/21/credit-suisse-buy-virgin-galactic-for-near-term-monopoly-on-space-tourism.html?&qsearchterm=,8,0,585,1.

Analysts at the firm previously expected Disney's new streaming service to finish the year with 14.3 million subscribers. Despite launching with some technical errors, Disney reported 10 million Disney+ sign-ups one day after launch, sending the stock up 7.35%. Disney also partnered with Verizon before the launch to offer Verizon customers a free year of Disney+. The company has not reported subscriber numbers since the initial report. ""For Disney, we are raising our Disney+ estimate once again to 20.0m as of December 31st from 14.3m due to app downloads settling out at a reasonable level and Verizon indicating Disney+ sign-ups have come in well ahead of expectations (though we left bottom line estimates unchanged),"" Credit Suisse analysts said in a note Saturday. Credit Suisse has an outperform rating on Disney's stock, and in November it placed a 12-month price target of $163 per share, up from a previous target of $150 announced in September. The analysts said they expect a slow start to 2020 for Disney+ but predict subscriber numbers will climb again after the streaming service launches in Europe on March 31. They expect another pop after the October 2020 launch in Latin America. Bolstered by the successful initial launch, Disney will continue to throw more money behind the streaming service, the analysts expect. ""As with our prior increase, we assume the higher Disney+ subscribers and revenue is offset by management spending more aggressively behind the successful launch,"" the analysts said. At $6.99 per month or $69.99 per year, Disney+ is significantly cheaper than competitors such as Netflix, which charges $12.99 for its most popular standard HD plan. It also can be bundled alongside Disney's other streaming services, ESPN+ and ad-supported Hulu for $12.99 a month. The analysts said the bundle has not proven a strong offering, marked by Disney's separate marketing efforts to promote Hulu. ""Hulu reprised a Black Friday promotion again this year with a $2/mo. for 12 months offer for its $6/mo. ad-supported SVOD service,"" they said. ""While up from its $1/mo. promo from last year, this suggests that momentum for the Disney+/Hulu/ESPN+ bundle offering is not strong enough to allow Hulu to ease its own marketing spending."" Disney managed a successful launch of Disney+ in a crowded sector that will only become more competitive in the months to come. In the coming months, AT&T's WarnerMedia will launch HBO Max and Comcast's NBCUniversal will start its first streaming service called Peacock. Apple's streaming service Apple TV+ launched earlier this month, but its library is limited to just a handful of shows.

Credit Suisse shocking call: Fed will launch 'QE4' before year-end to stem Street cash crunch,"A fourth round of quantitative easing will be needed before year's end to address stresses in short-term lending markets, according to Credit Susse analyst Zoltan Pozsar.So-called QE4 would help rebuild bank reserves, which have dropped as the Fed has shrunk its balance sheet, Pozsar said.Market experts continue to dissect the problems in repo markets that flared up in mid-September.","The Federal Reserve could be launching another round of money-printing in the next few weeks as problems in the overnight lending markets reemerge and force the central bank into more aggressive action, according to a Credit Suisse analysis. A fourth version of quantitative easing — often referred to as ""money-printing"" for the way the Fed uses digitally created money to buy bonds from big financial institutions — would be needed by year's end to bridge a funding gap as banks scramble for scarce reserves, Zoltan Pozsar, Credit Suisse's managing director for investment strategy and research, said in a note to clients. ""If we're right about funding stresses, the Fed will be doing 'QE4' by year-end,"" Pozsar wrote. ""Treasury yields can spike into year-end, and the Fed will have to shift from buying bills to buying what's on sale – coupons."" That would mean a shift from purchasing short-term Treasury debt and expanding into longer duration and more aggressive balance sheet expansion. The Fed is in the midst of a buying T-bills in a process that it has insisted is not QE but instead an effort to keep its benchmark overnight funds rate within the 1.5%-1.75% target range. In addition to the outright purchases, the central bank is conducting daily repurchase operations to stabilize the market. All of those efforts stem from mid-September tumult in the repo market, the place where banks go to get overnight funding critical to their operations. A Sept. 17 spike in rates amplified funding issues that Pozsar said are not going away. ""The Fed's liquidity operations have not been sufficient to relax the constraints banks will face in the upcoming year-end turn,"" he said, adding that investors have become complacent after an initial flare-up in 2018 turned out to be ""benign"" and as ""repo rates have been trading normally since the September blowout"" and amid the Fed's efforts to keep reserves plenty. ""But these facts are less relevant than they seem,"" Pozsar said. In fact, he warned of even potentially more dire consequences should market dislocations and another spike in rates upset the carry trades institutions employ, where lower-yielding currencies are used to buy those with higher yields, with investors pocketing the difference. ""If carry makes the world go 'round, and reserves make carry possible … the day we run out of reserves would be the day when the world would stop spinning."" Pozsar said. ""No, this is not an overstatement."" The problems he identified are twofold — a Fed that raised rates too much and cut its bond holdings and balance sheet too quickly, coming at the same time as Basel III international banking guidelines made capital requirements more stringent. Before the balance sheet rundown, the Fed had been running what it considered an ""ample reserves"" regime, where reserves a year ago had been around $1.8 trillion. That number dropped close to $1.4 trillion in September, and the Fed has wrestled since with what is the right number. Pozsar specifically described the potential QE4 process as helping ""through the backdoor,"" with the Fed buying back the bonds that banks were forced to buy during the balance sheet rundown ""and giving back the reserves they gave up in the process."" Poszar said the concept of excess reserves is now ""an oxymoron"" due to the new capital requirements. His analysis, however, is fairly contrarian. While there remain concerns about how the Fed calibrates the right level of reserves, most fixed income experts think the central bank's market operations have kept the market running smoothly. Indeed, the funds rate for the past month has been trading at 1.55%, which is near the bottom end of the target range. The Fed usually is satisfied if the rate trades around the midpoint, which would be about 1.62%. Still, he points out that since the Fed reversed its balance sheet contraction and started buying Treasury notes, actual reserves have grown little. The Fed's balance sheet since mid-September has expanded by nearly $300 billion to $4.1 trillion; reserves in that time have expanded by about $110 billion. A Bank for International Settlements analysis of the issue, released Monday, also warned of future funding problems and said the Fed's diagnosis of the September tumult was incomplete. Central bank officials have attributed the upset to a surge of corporate tax payments and an unusually large Treasury auction settlement as sucking capital out of the system. However, the BIS said hedge funds and big banks contributed as well, with the former placing high capital demands on the market while the latter did not provide liquidity as the market became stressed. The BIS did note that the Fed's operations have ""calmed markets.""",2019-12-10 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2019/12/10/fed-qe4-could-happen-before-years-end-credit-suisse-says.html?&qsearchterm=,2,0,776,-1.

"Brex, the start-up that lends to other start-ups, taps $200 million line from Credit Suisse","The San Francisco-based company raised $200 million in debt from Credit Suisse, following a similar $100 million deal from Barclays in April.Brex CFO Michael Tannenbaum says the deal will help scale the two-year old company, last valued at $2.6 billion.Since Brex isn't a bank like some of its competitors, it has to rely on outside sources of funding -- either banks like Credit Suisse or alternate sources like family offices -- to make loans. ","Credit card start-up Brex is getting its own new line of credit. The San Francisco-based company, last valued at $2.6 billion, secured $200 million in debt from Credit Suisse to grow its business of issuing corporate cards to fellow start-ups, according to chief financial officer Michael Tannenbaum. Having a bigger line of credit could be key for two-year old Brex as it seeks to compete with the likes of American Express. ""We've probably raised more equity than we needed because we compete with financial institutions,"" Tannenbaum said in a phone interview. ""You're trusting Brex to offer financial services — the stronger the balance sheet is, the better Brex is as a partner and as a service provider."" Brex was co-founded by 24-year-old Henrique Dubugras and 23-year-old Pedro Franceschi. Even by the standards of Silicon Valley, the rise of Brex has been meteoric: It reached unicorn status last year just months after publicly launching its first product, then doubled in value this June. The company lends to tens of thousands of start-ups, riskier businesses that could fail in droves if a recession strikes or venture capital funding dries up. Since Brex isn't a bank like some of its competitors, it has to rely on outside sources of funding — either banks like Credit Suisse or alternate sources like family offices — to make loans. This is Brex's second line of credit following a $100 million line from Barclays in April. The company has also raised $315 million in equity from PayPal alumni Peter Thiel and Max Levchin, as well as venture capital giant Kleiner Perkins. Brex started with credit cards last year, but expanded into bank-like products in October with the launch of a high-interest cash management product. Both are fuel for the growth of a business, but debt and equity have different purposes for start-ups. In the case of Brex, Tannenbaum said they use equity mostly to invest in products and software and hire people. Debt, on the other hand, is backed by the firm's corporate charge card receivables and is crucial to extend more credit to customers. So-called warehouse lines of credit are typical for card businesses, and let balance-sheet intensive businesses extend more credit to their own customers. Petal, another Peter Thiel-backed credit card start-up, raised a $300 million debt round from Jefferies earlier this year. Not all debt is the same though. WeWork, for example, raised debt as part of its short-lived IPO plans. Banks that issued WeWork's debt were also linked to the public offering and had options to convert that to stock. Brex on the other hand said it has no equity-type features in this deal. The debt is not convertible to stock if the company were to go public, according to the CFO. Tannenbaum, former chief revenue officer at SoFi, would not comment on IPO plans or profitability. But he said raising debt is typically seen as a vote of confidence as businesses getting debt packages undergo scrutiny by bankers.

In a statement Friday morning, the board of directors said it had unanimously accepted Thiam's resignation, following the presentation of the Swiss lender's fourth-quarter and full-year results. Chairman Urs Rohner said Thiam has made an ""enormous contribution"" to the bank since he joined in 2015. He will step down on Feb. 14. ""Under Tidjane's leadership, Credit Suisse simultaneously repurposed our strategy, restored our capital, reduced our costs, de-risked our business, promoted diversity and engendered an exceptional level of co-operation between various divisions,"" he said. ""It is to his credit that Credit Suisse is standing on a very solid foundation and has returned successfully to profit."" Thiam said he was proud of what his team had accomplished during his tenure, adding in a statement that they had ""turned Credit Suisse around"" and that he would be an ""enthusiastic supporter"" of his colleagues' endeavors. The French-Ivorian joined Credit Suisse from Prudential in March 2015. Credit Suisse shares fell 4.2% at the start of Friday's trading session. The news follows a drawn-out spying scandal at the bank, after former wealth management boss Iqbal Khan, who was heading to rival UBS, was followed by private contractors in a bid to establish whether he was poaching colleagues and clients. An internal investigation by law firm Homburger into the scandal which rocked the bank in 2019 was said to have found ""zero evidence"" that Thiam was aware of the surveillance. ""I had no knowledge of the observation of two former colleagues. It undoubtedly disturbed Credit Suisse and caused anxiety and hurt. I regret that this happened and it should never have taken place,"" Thiam reiterated on Friday morning. However, the investigation directly resulted in the exit of COO Pierre-Olivier Bouee, claiming that he acted alone in directing the spying, and raised questions over how Thiam was kept out of the loop in an espionage plot devised and executed by one of his top executives. The scandal also resulted in the suicide of the private investigator who worked as a middleman between Switzerland's second-largest bank and the private security firm. Thiam told CNBC in October that this event was what led to the resignation of individuals. Khan filed a complaint with police in September after reportedly spotting an investigator following him and his wife in Zurich, though conflicting accounts of the incident have emerged. He left Credit Suisse in July following a deterioration of his relationship with Thiam. The saga triggered an investigation from Swiss regulator FINMA into compliance and corporate governance issues associated with the surveillance activities. A spokesperson for the regulator told CNBC on Friday that FINMA ""is continuing its investigations concerning observation activities in order to clarify matters relevant to supervision (namely corporate governance issues)."" The board also voted unanimously to reaffirm its support for Rohner to complete his term as chairman until April 2021. The board's lead independent director, Severin Schwan, said Friday that Rohner has led the board ""commendably during this turbulent time"" and has its ""full support."" Friday's development defies the wishes of the bank's major shareholders, with Harris Associates, Silchester International and U.S. hedge fund Eminence Capital all hoping that Thiam would stay at the bank. Reuters reported, citing sources close to the bank, that the scandal has strained relations between Rohner and Thiam, with the embattled CEO struggling to win the backing of the board despite having shareholders in his corner. Speaking to CNBC Friday, Vontobel Senior Analyst Andreas Venditti said the announcement would likely help to ""calm things down"" but went ""totally against"" the ""very explicit support statements"" from shareholders. In a note following the news, Citi banking analysts suggested that the risk of shareholder rotation and staff departures, including a re-shuffle of senior management, was now on the cards. James Athey, senior investment manager at Aberdeen Standard, told CNBC's ""Street Signs"" on Friday that the key question now is how the leadership structure will take shape. ""If there has been some evidence, where we thought previously that this knowledge hadn't filtered up to that board level and maybe it has, why is the chairman still in place?"" Silchester International declined to comment when approached by CNBC Friday. Harris Associates and Eminence Capital did not immediately respond to requests for comment. Credit Suisse will be looking to put the scandal to bed with the appointment of Gottstein, who has been with the bank for 20 years and has headed up the Swiss domestic market since 2015. During his tenure, the Swiss business increased its contribution to group income before tax from 1.6 billion Swiss francs to 2.1 billion Swiss francs, and several analysts on Friday referred to Gottstein as a ""safe pair of hands."" In a statement Friday, Gottstein thanked Thiam and the board for their support and said he was looking forward to devoting his ""full energy to this treasured bank, its clients and shareholders.""

Thiam's departure comes amid an investigation by Swiss regulator FINMA following two instances of former Credit Suisse employees, including former wealth management boss Iqbal Khan, being placed under surveillance. The outgoing CEO has maintained that he was not aware of the spying operation, which led to the resignation of COO Pierre-Olivier Bouee and the suicide of a private investigator, prompting concerns over how both Thiam and Chairman Urs Rohner were kept out of the loop. Bruno Verstraete, partner at Zurich-based asset manager Lakefield Partners, said the timing of Thiam's ouster had come as a surprise, and suggested that an acceleration of the FINMA investigation could have been the catalyst. ""This spying scandal has gone on for months and what we are seeing is that after the weekend the storm has not really receded, in fact quite the contrary,"" Verstraete told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe."" ""It looks as if the pressure now is away from Thiam, who has a good leaver agreement with the bank, and that the pressure is now on the highest organ of the company, which is Rohner."" Severin Schwan, the independent director of the board, said alongside the announcement on Friday that Rohner maintained the board's full backing as chairman until the end of his tenure in April 2021. However, the ousting of Thiam contradicted calls for support for the embattled CEO from major shareholders Eminence Capital, Silchester International and Harris Associates. ""It is very hard to imagine that you don't know about it and that as such is already a bad sign, and did apparently bring FINMA into the game, because as the highest organ you are supposed to know about this,"" Verstraete added. Credit Suisse acknowledged the reputational damage brought about by the spying scandal, but since the news of Khan's complaint to Swiss police emerged in September, the lender's shares are up by around 5% and net inflows have not been impacted materially. Filippo Alloatti, senior credit analyst at Federated Hermes, told CNBC Monday that reputational damage of this magnitude ""takes some time to filter through,"" but added that Thiam's restructuring of the bank had largely been successful in setting the trajectory back toward growth. Credit Suisse reported higher-than-expected net income of 881 million Swiss francs ($886.9 million) for the third quarter of 2019 and doubled its return on tangible equity year-on-year. At the time, the group warned of headwinds from a ""challenging geopolitical environment,"" but some of that risk associated with the U.S.-China trade war and Brexit uncertainty has since abated.

His resignation came after a drawn-out spying scandal at the bank. A former Credit Suisse executive, Iqbal Khan, was followed by private contractors in a bid to establish whether he was poaching colleagues and clients to join him at UBS. An internal investigation by law firm Homburger said there was ""zero evidence"" that Thiam had been involved in the surveillance scheme. Nonetheless, this probe led to the exit of Pierre-Oliver, the bank's chief operating officer, and raised questions as to how Thiam was unaware of the surveillance on Khan. Swiss regulator FINMA is still investigating the incident. Reports suggest there's a power struggle between the bank's chairman, Urs Rohner, and Thiam.

"Asia stocks may not rise much further as fundamentals remain weak, Credit Suisse says","Asian equities are expected to trade within a limited range in the near term, according to Credit Suisse's Suresh Tantia. Major indexes in Japan, South Korea, Australia and Hong Kong are all down year-to-date, but are off lows seen in mid-March.  Tantia said the consensus full-year 2020 earnings estimate for the MSCI Asia ex-Japan Index has been revised lower by 16% and is now expected to grow 4% from a year ago. ","In this article Asian equities are expected to trade within a limited range in the near term, according to a strategist at Swiss investment bank Credit Suisse, who cited earnings trends that suggest that fundamentals remain weak. Stocks rallied from earlier lows, driven in part by unprecedented policy stimulus from central banks around the world, Suresh Tantia, a senior investment strategist at the bank, told CNBC.  ""We believe Asian equities will enter a consolidation in the near term,"" said Tantia in an email. When shares consolidate, they typically trade within a limited price range.  ""The Fed's action has addressed the (U.S. dollar) funding stress, stalling USD strength which has reduced outflows from the region in April,"" he added. As investor confidence in the stock market wobbled in March over the uncertainty from the coronavirus pandemic, the demand for U.S. dollars surged. That demand came from a variety of sources including banks, investors selling dollar-based assets and issuers of dollar-denominated debt. All that drove the greenback higher against other currencies, and led to the outflow of funds from Asia. The U.S. dollar index, which measures the greenback against a basket of its peers, rose from below 96 to above 102 in March, before slipping slightly as the Federal Reserve stepped in with measures to improve access to the dollar. As of 9:08 a.m. HK/SIN on Tuesday, the index traded around 99.572. The Fed's actions helped prevent equities from falling further. However, Tantia pointed out: ""Though these factors have been able to put a floor under the markets, the fundamentals need to improve for regional equities to rally from current levels."" The global recession will have ""a severe impact on corporate profitability, leading analysts to lower their earnings expectations,"" he added. Major indexes in Japan, South Korea, Australia and Hong Kong are all down year-to-date, though they are off the lows seen in March.   Tantia said the consensus full-year 2020 earnings estimate for the MSCI Asia ex-Japan Index has been revised lower by 16% and is now expected to grow 4% from a year ago.  Credit Suisse expects estimates will be further revised lower in the coming months, capping the upside for regional markets and making it hard for stocks to rally further. While Asian equities over the last 15 years have moved largely in tandem with their earnings estimates, the ""present situation is an anomaly,"" where the earnings outlook has weakened sharply but the market is staying strong, according to BNP Paribas' head of equity research for Asia-Pacific, Manishi Raychaudhuri. ""It appears, either the market is expecting a V-shaped recovery in earnings estimates or it is ignoring 2020 (earnings per share) estimates for now and looking at 2021,"" Raychaudhuri said in a note on May 15, adding that the latter possibility seems more likely, though estimates for next year are also declining.  South Asia is likely to take a bigger hit from the ongoing global recession than North Asia, as countries in South Asia have been relatively less successful so far in containing the virus, according to Tantia.  India, for example, has been in a national lockdown since late March. On Sunday, those measures were further extended until the end of May and by Tuesday, reported coronavirus cases topped 100,000 — but restrictions in less risky areas will be gradually eased.  Most of those countries also have limited fiscal space to adequately offset the fallout from the extreme lockdown, Tantia said. In addition, he said South Asian countries will likely see bigger negative impact in terms of earnings and the outlook is unlikely to improve until there are ""credible signs of (the) virus coming under control.""  In contrast, countries in North Asia — such as China and South Korea — appear to have contained the outbreak for now and are starting to lift restrictions slowly.

"Credit Suisse sees 'improving' fundamentals for Asia stocks, with Hong Kong at its 'cheapest' levels in decades","As the world attempts to restart economies ravaged by lockdowns intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Credit Suisse's Ray Farris sees an opportunity in Asia.Farris said there are three main factors behind this view, including Asia being ""cheap"" relative to many other developed markets.","In this article As the world attempts to restart economies ravaged by lockdowns intended to curb the spread of the coronavirus, Credit Suisse sees an opportunity in Asia, where the fundamentals for stocks are ""improving."" Ray Farris, the firm's chief investment officer for South Asia, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Wednesday morning that there were three main factors behind this view. Firstly, the dollar is beginning to weaken, Farris said. ""A second key factor in Asia's favor is that global liquidity levels continue to rise and within Asia itself … liquidity levels are rising,"" he said. Thirdly, Farris added that Asia looks ""cheap"" at these levels as compared with many developed markets — particularly the U.S. The Credit Suisse exec pointed to Hong Kong as an example. ""A market like Hong Kong, it's about the cheapest it's been in decades,"" Farris said. ""Although earnings there are going to suffer in the same way that earnings suffer everywhere — the gap between the extent of the fall in earnings in Hong Kong versus how much earnings have fallen in the U.S. — is, again, at almost record levels."" Farris made his comments on Wednesday morning. The benchmark Hang Seng index has fallen more than 13% year to date, as of its last close. Furthermore, he added, the magnitude of the earnings decline in Hong Kong has not been ""nearly as large"" as in the West.  ""We see that repeated across many of the Asian markets so we think dynamics are moving increasingly in Asia's favor,"" Farris said. Given recent political uncertainty after China's approval of controversial national security legislation for the city, Farris said: ""We used to be underweight Hong Kong, we've recently gone overweight."" ""The reason for that is valuations, we think, now fully price in all of those risks,"" he said. ""Everybody knows about the national security law, the market's been beaten up as a result, and yet earnings are not weakening nearly as much as in comparable countries."" On a relative basis, he added, Hong Kong is ""cheap"" and looks like it is ""going to be able to produce a better earnings outcome."" ""We're at the stage where we think that Hong Kong can begin to do a bit better than some other markets,"" Farris said.",2020-06-18 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/18/credit-suisse-sees-improving-fundamentals-for-asia-stocks.html?&qsearchterm=,2,0,379,1.

One of the main growth areas in China's markets is the technology sector, according to Ray Farris, chief investment officer for South Asia at Credit Suisse. The technology landscape in China is fiercely competitive where established tech giants regularly fend off new rivals trying to take away chunks of their market share.","In this article SINGAPORE — China's equity and bond markets are set to give investors progressively greater opportunities in 2021, according to Credit Suisse. Chinese markets offer ""high rates of growth at still attractive valuations,"" the Swiss investment bank said in its 2021 outlook report. The world's second-largest economy is predicted to be one of the few countries to register a positive GDP figure this year after bringing the coronavirus outbreak relatively under control. Credit Suisse predicted China will record 2.2% growth for 2020, followed by a sharp jump to 7.1% in 2021. One of the main growth areas in China's markets is the technology sector, according to Ray Farris, chief investment officer for South Asia at Credit Suisse. China is ""one of the few economies that has a credible and rapidly growing tech sector,"" Farris said on CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Wednesday."" The technology landscape in China is fiercely competitive, where established tech giants regularly fend off new rivals trying to take away chunks of their market share. ""Unlike in the United States, where tech has recently been seen as something of an alternative to value trades, if we look at the performance of China tech on announcements of positive news on vaccines, China tech's actually benefiting because in China, tech is very much a growth play,"" he added. Value investing refers to a strategy of picking stocks that appear to be trading for less than their book value — essentially, they are said to be stocks that the market is underestimating. Chinese tech companies are ""stealing market share"" from offline players in retail, health care, education and the like and that trend will continue, Farris explained. ""So, stronger growth in China will just simply produce stronger growth in China's tech sector."" Some of the biggest Chinese tech names include Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu, and Meituan. MSCI China earnings are expected to grow from 2% in 2020 to 21% in 2021, according to the Credit Suisse report. It added that strong earnings growth works to keep valuations relatively low. Still, Farris highlighted several risks that China faces, starting with a resurgence in coronavirus infection cases. ""Another would be that U.S. policy turns even more aggressive with China and more disruptive than it has been. We think that's unlikely with a Biden administration,"" he said, adding that President-elect Joe Biden's approach would be more predictable and rules-based. While regulatory pressure is also a risk, it is unlikely to derail growth in China's technology sector, according to Farris. Earlier this month, Chinese regulators drafted a slew of new anti-monopoly laws that likely target the country's major internet companies — tech shares took a beating after the draft regulations were announced. ""If I look at the recent regulatory actions, they appear to be somewhat sensible. And they don't appear to be anything that really is going to change this secular trend in the large tech companies in China, growing by gaining market share from offline,"" Farris said, adding that the outlook remains optimistic.",2020-11-25 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/25/credit-suisse-regulatory-risks-wont-stop-chinas-tech-growth-in-2021.html?&qsearchterm=,4,0,501,"1.

The Swiss bank has forecast 19% in U.S. dollar returns for the MSCI Asia excluding Japan Index between now and the end of 2021, compared with 15% globally. ""Asia ex-Japan is our biggest overweight globally,"" Dan Fineman, co-head of Asia-Pacific equity strategy at Credit Suisse, said in a webinar Thursday that discussed the bank's 2021 outlook. Fineman said growth in earnings-per-share or EPS — a widely used metric to estimate a company's value — could be sustained in the ""teens"" for three to five years at least across the region. It will be driven by factors such as stabilizing economic growth and reduced tax pressure, he said. In addition, improving exports and appreciating currencies will also support Asian stocks, which are still under-owned by foreign investors, said Fineman. Among Asian markets, Credit Suisse likes South Korea the most, forecasting an EPS growth of 43% in 2021. Fineman said Korean stocks are cheaper than their North Asian peers, and South Korea is home to major manufacturers of the so-called DRAM chips — a segment within technology that Credit Suisse likes. DRAM stands for dynamic random-access memory, and is a type of semiconductor memory chips used in devices such as laptops and smartphones. ""If you look at the Korean market and the Korean economy, it's very cyclical. When you are expecting a global economic upturn, it's a good time to be in Korea,"" he explained.   Other Asian markets that Credit Suisse likes are: In terms of sectors, Credit Suisse's favorite is real estate given signs of recovery in some markets, especially Hong Kong. Property purchases could get a boost from low short-term interest rates — which most mortgages in Asia are priced against, said the Swiss bank. Bank stocks in the region, which have been ""very cheap,"" will also benefit from improving global economic growth, said Fineman.

Abrams' comments came as automakers globally are shutting assembly lines due to problems in the delivery of semiconductors, according to Reuters. The current shortage comes as chipmakers scaled down production around the middle of last year as customers cut back orders, Abrams explained. He added that the shortfall in chips for the auto sector has created a bottleneck whereby vehicles cannot be built due to the lack of certain components. ""I do think by middle of the year, we should be starting to catch up,"" he said, but warned it'll be ""a tough couple of quarters catching up to those orders."" Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company, the world's leading foundry, is among the companies still trying to catch up with the increased demand. Reuters reported Monday that TSMC will prioritize production of auto chips if the firm is able to further increase capacity. The report cited Taiwan's Economics Ministry. The Covid-19 pandemic upended nearly every industry in the world as businesses and economies were forced to shut down due to the lockdowns, triggering supply chain problems and widespread job losses. The auto industry was not spared, with Boston Consulting Group predicting in a December report that sales in Europe and the U.S. ""will not rebound to pre-COVID levels until 2023 at the earliest."" The shortage highlights the ""strategic importance"" of chips, Abrams said. ""For the first time in a long time, semiconductors are limiting auto production,"" he added. Beyond the automotive industry, those challenges are also seen in other sectors such as cloud computing and artificial intelligence, he said. There are now less manufacturers capable of making more advanced chips compared to previous upturns in the sector, the Credit Suisse analyst said, citing Samsung Electronics and Intel as the other two ""advanced manufacturers"" with such capabilities. ""It's a reality the industry is having to deal with — it's becoming more complicated to make advanced chips,"" Abrams said. Competition among the top chipmakers is also heating up. Intel, which has lost market share to competitors including AMD, Samsung and TSMC, recently announced the appointment of industry veteran Pat Gelsinger as CEO.  Meanwhile, Bloomberg reported Friday that Samsung Electronics is considering building its most advanced logic chipmaking plant in the U.S. That came after TSMC said in May that it will build a semiconductor facility in Arizona, with total spending on the project coming it at $12 billion. — CNBC's Lauren Feiner and Arjun Kharpal contributed to this report.",2021-01-27 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/01/27/chipmakers-will-take-quarters-to-catch-up-with-auto-sector-demand-credit-suisse.html?&qsearchterm=,2,0,463,0.

He will replace Eric Varvel, who will continue as CEO of Credit Suisse Holdings and chairman of the investment bank. The Swiss investment bank is trying to contain the damage from the collapse of Greensill, a supply-chain finance business that it had ties with. Greensill, which fell into administration last week, claims on its website that it ""unlocks finance so the world can put it to work"" and in 2020, it issued over $143 billion in finance to over 10 million customers. The London-headquartered firm, in which Japan's SoftBank invested around $1.5 billion, filed for administration after its insurance provider refused to renew $4.6 billion of insurance for its loans. Credit Suisse had several links to Greensill including $10 billion worth of funds. It said it was suspending the funds linked to Greensill on March 1. This funding offered exposure to Greensill loans and were marketed to the bank's clients as low-risk investments. Credit Suisse said that some investors had threatened to take legal action and warned that it could lose clients over the issue. The bank said its board was investigating the company's ties with Greensill and it may ask some staff to pay back bonuses they were previously issued. ""The payout and vesting of variable compensation of a number of senior employees involved in these matters, up to and including executive board members, has been suspended as a measure to ensure that we can reconsider the variable compensation for 2020 and are able to apply malus or clawback, if appropriate,"" the bank said Thursday in its 2020 compensation report. It added: ""The compensation committee is monitoring developments closely and will determine, based on investigation results, any appropriate actions to be applied."" Credit Suisse said its asset management business — which housed the controversial supply chain funds — will now be separated from its international wealth management division.

Investment Bank CEO Brian Chin and Chief Risk and Compliance Officer Lara Warner will step down from their roles with immediate effect, the bank said. Last week, Credit Suisse revealed that it was expecting heavy losses in the wake of the meltdown of U.S. hedge fund Archegos Capital. The bank was forced to dump a significant amount of stock to sever its ties to the troubled family office. The executive board has also waived its bonuses for the 2020 financial year, the bank announced Tuesday, with Chairman Urs Rohner giving up his ""chair fee"" of 1.5 million Swiss francs. At its AGM on April 30, Credit Suisse will now propose a dividend of 0.10 Swiss francs gross per share along with the amended compensation report. ""Particularly following the significant US-based hedge fund matter, the Board of Directors is amending its proposal on the distribution of dividends and withdrawing its proposals on variable compensation of the Executive Board,"" the Swiss lender said in a trading update. It has suspended its share buyback program and said it does not intend to resume share purchases until it has regained its target capital ratios and restored its dividend. Credit Suisse shares gained 1.7% by late morning trade in Europe. Last month, the bank announced a shakeup of its asset management business and a suspension of bonuses as it looked to contain the damage from the collapse of British supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital. The Board has launched two separate investigations, to be carried out by third parties, into the Greensill and Archegos sagas, vowing to ""not only focus on the direct issues arising from each of them, but also reflect on the broader consequences and lessons learned."" Chin will be replaced at the helm of the investment bank on May 1 by Christian Meissner, currently Credit Suisse's co-head of international wealth management investment banking advisory and vice chairman of investment banking. Joachim Oechslin has been appointed interim chief risk officer and Thomas Grotzer interim global head of compliance as of Tuesday. All three will report to CEO Gottstein. ""In combination with the recent issues around the supply chain finance funds, I recognize that these cases have caused significant concern amongst all our stakeholders. Together with the Board of Directors, we are fully committed to addressing these situations. Serious lessons will be learned,"" Gottstein said in a statement. Beat Wittmann, chairman and partner at Zurich-based Porta Advisors, told CNBC on Tuesday that while the Credit Suisse case does not represent a systemic crisis, there could be ""more casualties"" unless the root causes are addressed in the banking sector. ""The danger is always that we just focus on changing people but stick to the same business models, the same incentives, exploiting the same regulatory loopholes,"" Wittmann said. ""The worst thing of all, particularly in European investment banks, they are only able to employ the 'B-league' U.S. investment bankers, and the shareholders of course are paying the price for that."" Wittmann also argued that European investment banks had not adapted to safeguard themselves in the same way as their American counterparts in the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis. ""The European banks simply continued with their universal banking model and if this is not changed really at the root cause of the problem, we will see more casualties this year in Europe and much bigger ones.

Investors look for answers from Credit Suisse earnings after Archegos and Greensill sagas,"Credit Suisse announced earlier this month that it took a $4.7 billion hit from the meltdown of U.S. family hedge fund Archegos Capital and now expects a pre-tax loss of around 900 million Swiss francs ($960.4 million) for the first quarter.Credit Suisse has pointed out that aside from the Archegos and Greensill sagas, it was on course for its strongest underlying quarter for a decade in terms of financial performance.","Following the booming profit beats of its Wall Street rivals, Credit Suisse is expected to report a significant loss on Thursday as it navigates the fallout from two high-profile crises. The Swiss lender announced earlier this month that it took a $4.7 billion hit from the meltdown of U.S. family hedge fund Archegos Capital and now expects a pre-tax loss of around 900 million Swiss francs ($960.4 million) for the first quarter. The Archegos saga led to the departure of the bank's investment bank CEO and chief risk and compliance officer, and was preceded by a separate shakeup in the asset management division in the wake of the collapse of British supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital. Credit Suisse ran $10 billion in funds tied to Greensill. Several U.S. banks which also served as prime brokers to Archegos managed to exit their trading positions after the hedge fund failed to meet margin calls, and have since produced some eye-catching first-quarter profit beats. Goldman Sachs reported an almost six-fold increase in net income while Morgan Stanley's profit jumped by 150%, despite it taking a $911 million loss from Archegos. Credit Suisse has pointed out that aside from the Archegos and Greensill sagas, it was on course for its strongest underlying quarter for a decade in terms of financial performance. However, investors will be looking for answers from the bank as to the extent of its exposure to Archegos and Greensill and whether further hits can be expected in the second quarter. ""Investors are unlikely to have all their questions answered at this stage, in particular with respect to Greensill risks, where the group has been providing periodic updates,"" Amit Goel, co-head of European banks equity research at Barclays, told CNBC on Wednesday. ""For Archegos the group may give more color if all the exposure has been exited, but if this isn't the case they may not disclose the residual positions/risk."" A little more detail can be expected on the steps management is taking to address risk management issues within the bank, Goel suggested, including the personnel changes made amid overhauls of the investment banking and asset management businesses in recent weeks. The bank has launched two independent investigations into both its investment banking and asset management operations in the wake of the Archegos and Greensill sagas, but possible backlash from Swiss regulator FINMA will also be on the radar for investors, according to Morningstar European Banks Equity Analyst Johann Scholtz. Scholtz also said he would be looking for evidence that ""clear and tangible steps have been taken to improve risk management"" and an ""indication of what the long-term impact on revenue could be from a recalibration of risk appetite."" ""I anticipate that CS will try and steer the conversation more towards the good underlying performance of the business,"" he added. The Financial Times reported last week, citing sources familiar with the bank's operations, that Credit Suisse had made cuts to bonus pool accruals and other one-off booked items, a move some analysts fear may disenfranchise employees. ""On the risk of further franchise impact, we and investors will be looking to see if the group has taken steps to support earnings and capital in the quarter, which could have a negative impact in the future,"" Goel said. ""For example, broad cuts to compensation across the IB (investment bank), which appears to be factored into the sell side analyst consensus, evidenced by a much lower cost:income ratio for (the first quarter of 2021) in the IB than in prior periods.""",2021-04-21 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/21/credit-suisse-earnings-investors-seek-answers-on-archegos-greensill.html?&qsearchterm=,4,1,587,"-1.

Credit Suisse says this could be the beginning of a 'multi-decade' opportunity for clean energy,"It's an ""exciting"" time for renewable energy firms because more policymakers around the world have committed to goals on carbon emissions, according to Phineas Glover of Credit Suisse.""We're at the beginning of possibly a multi-decade, secular investment opportunity in the energy transition,"" he told CNBC.But not everyone is convinced that the energy transition is moving quickly enough.","It's an ""exciting"" time for renewable energy firms because more policymakers around the world have committed to carbon emissions goals, according to Credit Suisse. ""I'm feeling fairly bullish on the current market conditions for energy transition beneficiaries,"" said Phineas Glover, the investment bank's Asia-Pacific head of environmental, social and governance (ESG) research. The energy transition refers to a move away from reliance on fossil fuels, and toward clean energy alternatives. ""We're at the beginning of possibly a multi-decade, secular investment opportunity in the energy transition,"" he told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Wednesday. That's in part because governments have taken steps that brought certainty to the market. Glover said there has been a lot of momentum in climate policy globally over the past 12 months, and pointed out that countries that have set targets to reach carbon neutrality now account for more than 60% of emissions, up from roughly 23% around a year ago. Not everyone is as upbeat about policy makers' commitments and promises. Carroll Muffett, chief executive at the non-profit Center for International Environmental Law, said the transition is moving too slowly and that some net-zero strategies actually depend on increasing fossil fuel use.  These policies typically ""rely heavily on unproven and potentially very hazardous carbon removal strategies to make that carbon dioxide magically disappear,"" he said. ""We are seeing that in the U.S., particularly in the context of proposed massive investment in carbon capture and storage,"" Muffett said. But Credit Suisse's Glover said he sees what happened in 2020 as a ""microcosm"" of what is going to happen in the long run. ""The improved policy certainty caused a very revealing reflection point … probably one of the biggest value rotations we've ever seen from fossil fuel exposures to the beneficiaries of the energy transition,"" he said. ""A fairly exciting time in terms of the beneficiaries."" He said in the past, the market only looked at the energy transition as a three-year or five-year growth opportunity. ""What we saw in 2020 was the market was willing to extrapolate the policy certainty, and therefore take a much longer-term view on the investment opportunity,"" Glover said. ""For that reason, I remain fairly bullish."" He also said that there are ""really interesting alpha opportunities"" in China, which still relies heavily on coal. ""Inevitably, there's going to be opportunities on both sides of the carbon equation,"" he said. ""There will be … those larger exposures to fossil fuel that will need to transition their businesses."" Glover acknowledged that some new coal power stations are being approved in China, but said many in the existing pipeline will soon reach the end of their useful life. ""If you combine that sequence of the decline in thermal coal power with this exciting growth trajectory in renewable energy, it creates really interesting alpha opportunities in the market,"" he said. — CNBC's Sam Meredith contributed to this report.",2021-04-22 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2021/04/22/credit-suisse-sees-a-multi-decade-investment-opportunity-in-clean-energy.html?&qsearchterm=,2,0,481,1.

Credit Suisse reports loss after Archegos scandal; CEO insists there's no risk culture problem,"""The loss we had in Archegos was unacceptable,"" Credit Suisse CEO Thomas Gottstein told CNBC Thusday.The Swiss lender expects to take an additional loss in the second quarter of around 600 million Swiss francs.Shares fell 5% in early European trading hours.","In this article LONDON — Credit Suisse reported Thursday a net loss of 252 million Swiss francs ($275 million) for the first quarter, at a time of increased pressure on the bank. Shares fell 5% in early European trading hours. It said the loss reflected a ""significant charge with respect to the US-based hedge fund matter in 1Q21 (first quarter), offsetting positive performance across wealth management and investment banking."" It comes after the Swiss lender warned of heavy losses earlier this month following a scandal involving Archegos Capital, a U.S. based hedge fund, which collapsed after taking on too much risk. Credit Suisse took a hit of 4.4 billion Swiss francs as a result, which it said on Thursday had ""significantly impacted"" first-quarter results. In addition, investment bank CEO Brian Chin and chief risk and compliance officer, Lara Warner, both stepped down. The executive board decided to waive bonuses for the 2020 year, and also cut the proposed dividend. Credit Suisse said Thursday that adjusted net revenue would have hit 7.4 billion Swiss francs excluding significant items if it hadn't been for the Archegos situation. This would have represented a 35% increase from a year ago. Putting the Archegos scandal aside, the bank's Chief Executive Thomas Gottstein told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore on Thursday that this was ""one of our best quarters in the history of Credit Suisse. Definitely the best quarter in the last 10 years."" ""The loss we had in Archegos was unacceptable and we had to take actions in terms of management changes. We are reducing our exposure in this business, we are reviewing our risk, controls and systems in that area,"" Gottstein added. In March, Credit Suisse also adjusted its asset management business and suspended bonuses after the collapse of Greensill Capital, a British supply chain finance firm. In his interview with CNBC, Gottstein said he had not offered his resignation to the board following the Archegos and Greensill cases. ""Look, this is the time for action, for remediation and to take the company to the next level. This is the time for solutions. We had a very difficult first quarter in terms of these two incidents, but at the same time, the operation performance that you saw in the first quarter proved our strategy was right and we are on the right track,"" Gottstein said. When asked if the bank had a culture of taking on too much risk, he said: ""We do not have a risk culture problem."" Credit Suisse said Thursday it had exited 97% of its trading positions relating to the Archegos hedge fund and expected to report an additional loss in the second quarter of around 600 million Swiss francs. The Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority said on Thursday it had opened enforcement proceedings against Credit Suisse due to its losses relating to Archegos' collapse. The regulator also said it had begun proceedings last month against the bank over the Greensill case. ""Supplementing measures taken by the bank, FINMA has in addition required various risk-reducing measures,"" the Swiss authority said in a statement. Other highlights in Credit Suisse's first-quarter earnings: In response to the results, Octavio Marenzi, CEO of consultancy firm Opimas, said in an email: ""It is such a shame – the Credit Suisse investment banking arm was about to turn in one of its best quarters ever, before the charges related to Archegos."" Maria Rivas, senior vice president at DBRS Morningstar, said the first quarter results ""highlight how excessive risk taking can lead to significant losses, potentially impacting capital and investor and shareholder confidence.""

""The demand that we see — both from our private clients, but also institutional clients — for ESG compatible products is ever increasing,"" Thomas Gottstein, who was speaking to CNBC's Geoff Cutmore, said. ""It's clearly seen as, also, an opportunity to improve returns."" ""There is no contradiction of sustainable investments and sustainable returns, quite the opposite actually,"" Gottstein added.

""U.S. sustainable bond funds outperformed their traditional peer funds by a median total return of 0.9 percentage points,"" it also noted. In a statement issued at the time, Audrey Choi, who is Morgan Stanley's chief sustainability officer and CEO of its Institute for Sustainable Investing, said: ""Sustainable funds' strong risk and return performance during an exceptionally turbulent year further erodes the persistent misconception that sustainable investing requires a performance sacrifice."" The term ESG stands for environmental, social and governance. It's become a hot topic in recent years, with a wide range of companies attempting to boost their credentials by developing business practices that chime with ESG-linked criteria. In his interview with CNBC, Gottstein described the sustainability and ESG movement as a ""global"" one. As an institution, Credit Suisse has placed ESG integration within its ""sustainable investing spectrum,"" which also includes thematic investing, impact investing and exclusion. The bank describes the latter as referring to a strategy whereby those investing ""can choose to actively exclude sectors or companies in controversial business areas — for example, weapons or tobacco.""

The Archegos saga dominated the business headlines in March, with Credit Suisse being the worst hit out of several international banks involved. Archegos built massive stakes in certain stocks through swaps, a type of derivative that investors trade over the counter or among themselves without having to disclose the holdings publicly and are highly leveraged. But a sell-off in these stocks meant the hedge fund was forced to inject more cash, amassing a forced liquidation of more than $20 billion. A report published Thursday based on an independent external investigation, which was commissioned by the bank's board of directors, found a failure to effectively manage risk in the prime services business at Credit Suisse's investment banking unit ""by both the first and second lines of defense as well as a lack of risk escalation."" ""It also found a failure to control limit excesses across both lines of defense as a result of an insufficient discharge of supervisory responsibilities in the Investment Bank and in Risk, as well as a lack of prioritization of risk mitigation and enhancement measures,"" the announcement said. One of the conclusions of the investigation said that ""it seems likely that Archegos deceived Credit Suisse and obfuscated the true extent of its positions, which Archegos amassed in the midst of an unprecedented global pandemic."" ""That said, the business and Risk had ample information well before the events of the week of March 22, 2021 that should have prompted them to take steps to at least partially mitigate the significant risks Archegos posed to Credit Suisse,"" it added. The investigation also pointed out that nobody at the Swiss bank ""appeared to fully appreciate the serious risks that Archegos's portfolio posed"" even though ""these risks were not hidden. They were in plain sight from at least September 2020."" Nonetheless, the investigation concluded that there had not been ""fraudulent or illegal conduct"" nor ill intent from its side and its employees. In the wake of the sandal, the head of its investment bank, Brian Chin, and chief risk and compliance officer, Lara Warner, stepped down. The executive board decided to waive bonuses for the 2020 year, and also cut the proposed dividend. Thomas Gottstein, CEO of Credit Suisse, told CNBC Thursday: ""We are taking this event very seriously from the magnitude, but also how it happened and we want to take all the right lessons."" He also told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore that Credit Suisse wants to make sure that ""an accident like Archegos will not happen again."" The outcome of the investigation was published at the same time as the Swiss lender reported its second-quarter results. Credit Suisse said its net income reached 253 million Swiss francs ($278.3 million) for the three-month period ending June, missing expectations in its own poll of analysts. With a figure of 1.16 billion Swiss francs for the same time last year, it meant that net profit had seen a drop of 78% over the year. At the end of the first quarter, Credit Suisse reported a hit of 4.4 billion Swiss francs due to the Archegos saga. However, Credit Suisse said Thursday that it was taking an additional pre-tax loss of 594 million Swiss francs related to the hedge fund collapse. Credit Suisse has also been dealing another scandal involving Greensill Capital which filed for administration earlier this year. Going forward, the bank said it wants to follow ""a more conservative approach to risk"" and to operate with a CET1 ratio, a measure of bank solvency, of at least 13%.

","In this article Credit Suisse has beaten analyst estimates for the third quarter, but took a hit from charges settling allegations of corruption in Mozambique and other legal issues. The Swiss bank also revealed that it expects to report a net loss in the final quarter of 2021 and said it plans to scale back its investment banking operations. Credit Suisse said Thursday that net income attributable to shareholders came in at 434 million Swiss francs ($476 million) for the third quarter, above analyst estimates of 333.8 million Swiss francs according to data from Refinitiv. However, the third-quarter results were down over 20% from a year earlier. The bank said gains in its income was hit by ""major litigation charges"" of 564 million Swiss francs, including 214 million Swiss francs relating to its settlement over the ""Mozambique matter"" and ""litigation provisions in connection with certain other legacy matters."" The Swiss bank has been fined by global regulators following a corruption scandal involving Mozambique's tuna fishing industry. Credit Suisse also reported that revenue rose to 5.4 billion Swiss francs in the third quarter, from 5.2 billion Swiss francs a year ago, and that its CET 1 ratio, a measure of bank solvency, was 14.4%, up from 13% a year earlier. Credit Suisse also announced a number of changes to its organizational structure. From January, the bank will reduce its business in investment banking, exiting the majority of its prime services business. As such, it expects equity sales and trading revenues to fall in the coming months. This comes after a number of scandals involving the unit, including its relationship with the collapsed hedge fund Archegos. ""Our objectives are clear: we want to become a stronger, more customer-centric bank that puts risk management at the very core of its DNA to deliver sustainable growth for investors, clients and colleagues,"" Thomas Gottstein, chief executive officer of Credit Suisse, said in a statement. The bank said that, from January, it will be organized into four divisions (wealth management, investment bank, Swiss bank and asset management) across four locations (Switzerland, Europe, Middle East and Africa, Asia Pacific and the Americas). It announced a renewed focus on its wealth management division. Net revenue at this unit rose 3% to 3.3 billion Swiss francs in the third quarter, with assets under management up 9% to 843 billion Swiss francs. ""Wealth Management businesses returned to robust net new assets and higher transaction revenues sequentially, while recurring commissions & fees and client business volumes demonstrated strong year on year momentum,"" the bank said in its earnings release Thursday. Credit Suisse's investment banking division saw revenue rise 10% to 2.5 billion Swiss francs. Maria Rivas, senior vice president at DBRS Morningstar, said via email: ""We consider the strategic initiatives are needed to restore investor confidence in Credit Suisse's franchise, to reinforce the Group's wealth management and asset management businesses, where the Group sees significant growth opportunities, and to reduce risk in the Investment Bank, after the Archegos matter."" Looking ahead, the bank said it expects market volumes to slow in the coming weeks as trading settles down following the volatility sparked by the coronavirus pandemic. ""Overall, we expect to see a further reduction in market volumes for the remainder of 2021 as the trading environment normalizes compared to the elevated levels seen in 2020, particularly as central banks begin to signal the end of the monetary support provided during the COVID-19 crisis,"" it said in its release. The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it will soon start reducing the pace of its monthly bond purchases, as it looks to scale back its massive stimulus program. The bank said it would report a loss in the fourth quarter of this year due to an impairment of 1.6 billion Swiss francs relating to its acquisition of investment company Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette in 2000.

""In the developed market space, our favorite market is Japan,"" Tantia, senior investment strategist at Credit Suisse's Asia-Pacific CIO office, told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia"" on Thursday. ""Japan has massively underperformed the U.S. equity market this year despite a very strong earnings momentum,"" he said. As of its Friday close, Japan's Nikkei 225 has risen 7.89% for 2021. In comparison, the S&P 500 stateside has soared more than 24% in the same time period. The strategist said a series of ""building blocks"" are now in place for Japan to outperform globally in the coming quarters. Firstly, Tantia pointed to Japanese Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's resounding victory in the recent parliamentary election, describing the win as ""very positive for the market"" due to expectations that the country's leader will introduce more stimulus. The second factor, according to the strategist, is valuations. ""If you look at the valuation for the Japanese equity market, it's trading at a very attractive price compared to any other developed markets,"" he said Lastly, he pointed to the outlook for the Japanese yen, which has weakened more than 10% against the dollar so far this year.

UBS, Barclays, RBS, HSBC and Credit Suisse were fined a combined total of 344 million euros ($390 million), the commission said in a statement Thursday. The investigation, focused on the trading of G-10 currencies, revealed that foreign exchange traders in these five banks discussed sensitive information and trading plans. They occasionally coordinated their trading plans via a professional online chatroom called Sterling Lads, the commission said. Four of the banks' fines — UBS, Barclays, RBS and HSBC — were discounted by 10% as they acknowledged their participation in the cartel. Credit Suisse did not benefit from this reduction as it did not cooperate with authorities, the commission said. Its fine was reduced by 4% to reflect that the bank was not liable for all aspects of the case, however. UBS ultimately does not have to pay any fine as the bank received ""full immunity"" for revealing the existence of the cartel. ""Our cartel decisions to fine UBS, Barclays, RBS, HSBC and Credit Suisse send a clear message that the Commission remains committed to ensure a sound and competitive financial sector that is essential for investment and growth,"" Margrethe Vestager, Europe's competition chief, said in a statement. Barclays, Credit Suisse and HSBC declined to comment. A spokesperson for NatWest, the parent company of RBS, told CNBC via email: ""We are pleased to have reached this settlement regarding serious misconduct that took place in a single chatroom, and that involved a former employee of the bank, around a decade ago."" UBS said via email: ""This is a legacy matter where UBS was the first bank to disclose potential misconduct and we are pleased the matter is resolved.""

Credit Suisse became embroiled in yet another scandal as its chairman, Antonio Horta-Osorio, resigned after breaking coronavirus quarantine rules. Horta-Osorio had been tasked with overseeing the bank's new strategy following a string of issues, including the meltdown of U.S. family hedge fund Archegos Capital and the collapse of British supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital.

Lehmann.Analysts told CNBC that the bank had made the right call in removing Horta-Osorio, and that Lehmann was a wise appointment as the firm looks to deliver stability.","LONDON — Credit Suisse Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio resigned on Sunday after violating Covid-19 quarantine rules, the latest in a series of high-profile scandals that have rocked the Swiss bank in recent years. Horta-Osorio took over as chairman of Switzerland's second-biggest lender in April last year, with a mission to clean up its corporate culture after its damaging involvement with collapsed investment firm Archegos Capital and insolvent supply chain finance company Greensill. These came on the back of a bizarre and protracted spying saga which ultimately led to the resignation of former CEO Tidjane Thiam, who was replaced by Thomas Gottstein. Horta-Osorio, who was found by an internal investigation to have committed multiple breaches of Covid quarantine requirements in the U.K. and Switzerland, will be replaced by UBS executive Axel P. Lehmann. Credit Suisse has insisted that its strategic overhaul, announced in November and which includes a scaling back of its investment banking business, will continue undeterred. Analysts told CNBC Monday that the bank had made the right call in removing Horta-Osorio, and that Lehmann was a wise appointment as the firm looks to deliver stability. Bruno Verstraete, managing partner at Zurich-based asset manager Lakefield Partners, said Lehmann was a choice that represented the stability the bank needs, given his wealth of experience in risk management. ""One can only hope that the scandals will fade over time, and that they will be able to turn the nose of the ship in the right direction, away from the storm. It is about time, that is clear,"" Verstraete told CNBC. However, some emphasized that the problems run deeper than one individual, with the bank facing a litany of legal issues. ""I think the job at hand for Credit Suisse over the coming months and year is frankly to repair its risk management, to repair its reputation, and obviously one factor that needs to be looked at carefully is, can it retain its talent?"" said Bob Parker, investment committee member at Quilvest and former senior advisor at Credit Suisse. ""One thing that happened after Archego was that a number of talented people in the investment bank left the firm."" Credit Suisse's share price has taken a substantial hit over the past 12 months, and analysts have pointed to the divergence from the performance of its domestic rival UBS as an indication that investors remain skeptical about the turnaround. Credit Suisse is down more than 24% over the past year and was last trading at 9.37 Swiss francs ($10.25) per share on Monday morning, while UBS has gained more than 31% in the past 12 months to trade at around 18 Swiss francs per share. ""I think the performance of the share price in recent months clearly reflects the view by investors that a number of these legacy issues are going to take time to repair, and I think that is probably right,"" Parker said. Beat Wittmann, chairman of Zurich-based Porta Advisors, told CNBC that Credit Suisse will need to rebuild its reputation over time through changing its business practices and demonstrating leadership by example, rather than seeking quick PR victories or ""culture-washing."" ""The price performance difference between Credit Suisse and UBS is 50% — not five, 50% — and therefore the shares are cheap, but for many reasons cheap,"" Wittmann said. However, he suggested that if the new chairman and management team can deliver stability and a strategic redirection with ""discipline and focus,"" then Credit Suisse shares are a ""big buy"" at their current valuations. ""Key shareholders like Harris Associates, Dodge & Cox etc., have suffered for many years, and the general public as well, so it's all in the hands of management and the board to get this done. It's absolutely possible to get it done,"" he said. Credit Suisse's third-quarter revenues were strong and the bank beat profit expectations despite a hit from charges related to settling allegations of corruption in Mozambique, along with several other legal issues. Wittmann highlighted that along with sound financial fundamentals, Credit Suisse is operating against a very supportive macro backdrop. ""For banking businesses, the last year was one of the best years on record in terms of rising risk assets, record M&A activity, basically all factors aligned and in favor of such a bank,"" he said. Given the potential that could be unlocked should the revamp go as planned and the low share price, Wittmann said he would not be surprised to see strategic buyout efforts being launched for Credit Suisse, noting that ""the European landscape is overdue for consolidation,"" as several regulators have pointed out.",2022-01-17 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/01/17/credit-suisse-needs-to-salvage-reputation-and-personnel-after-latest-scandal.html?&qsearchterm=,12,0,760,"-1.

Credit Suisse issues fourth-quarter profit warning as legal costs rise,"The Swiss bank said a charge of roughly 500 million Swiss francs ($545 million) is expected to push its earnings to breakeven.The profit warning comes after a series of high-profile scandals that have rocked the bank in recent years. ""These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business,"" the bank said.","Credit Suisse announced on Tuesday that its fourth-quarter earnings are set to be ""negatively impacted"" by increased litigation provisions. The Swiss bank said a charge of roughly 500 million Swiss francs ($545 million) is expected to push its earnings to breakeven. The profit warning comes after a series of high-profile scandals that have rocked the bank in recent years. Most recently, Chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio resigned earlier this month after violating Covid-19 quarantine rules. ""Credit Suisse Group (Group) today announced that the reported profits for the fourth quarter 2021 will be negatively impacted by litigation provisions of approximately CHF 500 million, partly offset by gains on real estate sales of CHF 225 million,"" the bank said in a trading update on Tuesday. ""These litigation provisions have been incurred in respect of a number of cases where the Group has more proactively pursued settlements and primarily relate to legacy litigation matters from our investment banking business."" Credit Suisse added that this is expected to result in a ""reported pre-tax income/(loss) for the Group of approximately breakeven for the fourth quarter 2021."" The bank is scheduled to report fourth-quarter results on Feb. 10. The Swiss lender's investment bank suffered considerable hits in 2021 from its involvement with collapsed investment firm Archegos Capital and insolvent supply chain finance company Greensill. The departure of Horta-Osorio, who was brought in to clean up the bank's corporate culture in the wake of these sagas, followed the high-profile resignation of former CEO Tidjane Thiam in early 2020 following a bizarre and protracted spying scandal. Switzerland's second-largest lender also on Tuesday flagged a decline in trading revenues at its investment bank and wealth management businesses. It attributed this to both a seasonal slowdown and a ""reversion to more normal trading conditions"" after the unusually high volumes seen through 2020 and 2021. The investment bank is on course to post a loss on the back of a reduced risk appetite and exit from its prime services business, Credit Suisse said. It has set aside a 1.5 billion Swiss franc impairment for the division. The core wealth management business is also expected to be hit by a slowdown in transactions, giving ""modestly negative"" net new assets Credit Suisse announced that its 2021 CET1 ratio — a measure of bank solvency — is set to exceed its target of 14%, however, while its Tier 1 leverage ratio — a measure of financial strength — is expected to exceed 6%. Credit Suisse shares were only fractionally lower on Tuesday, and Francesco Castelli, head of fixed income at Banor Capital, told CNBC that the news was not as substantial as previous shocks involving the business, and markets were ""not so scared."" ""There is some residual kitchen-sinking and, of course, legacy issues are a big problem for Credit Suisse, but I think anyone who held on in the bank so far, they will not change their mind now,"" Castelli said. Kitchen-sinking refers to a communications strategy where a lot of bad news is deliberately released at the same time in an effort to mitigate the fallout. ""I think a lot of investors see in Credit Suisse a great franchise, a great business, of course with a lot of legacy issues, but the repositioning, the resizing the bank has done in the recent past I think is an interesting investment catalyst for the future,"" he added.

Shares were especially under pressure after CEO Elon Musk said on the company's most recent earnings call that Tesla would not deliver any new model vehicles to customers in 2022, including the Cyberbtruck, an experimental pickup. Instead, Musk informed shareholders that Tesla plans to focus on scaling production at its old and new factories, and to dedicate resources to developing a humanoid robot and driverless vehicle tech.

The Swiss lender posted a full-year net loss of 1.57 billion Swiss francs ($1.7 billion), well below expectations of a 377.95 million Swiss franc loss, according to Refinitiv. The bank reported a fourth quarter net loss attributable to shareholders of 2.01 billion Swiss francs. Analysts had expected a profit of 25.73 million Swiss francs. The bank said it took ""major litigation provisions"" of 1.1 billion Swiss francs in 2021. Credit Suisse has been embroiled in a series of high-profile scandals in recent years, most recently when its chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio resigned last month after repeatedly violating Covid-19 quarantine rules. Horta-Osorio had come in with the intention of cleaning up the bank's corporate culture after its investment banking division suffered considerable hits in 2021 due to its involvement with collapsed investment firm Archegos Capital and insolvent supply chain finance company Greensill. In the bank's earnings report, CEO Thomas Gottstein acknowledged that 2021 was a ""very challenging year"" for Credit Suisse. ""Our reported financial results were negatively impacted by the Archegos matter, the impairment of goodwill relating to the Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette (DLJ) acquisition in 2000 and litigation provisions, as we look to proactively resolve legacy issues,"" Gottstein said. During the last three quarters of the year, Gottstein said the bank was run with a ""constrained risk appetite across all divisions,"" as it attempted to strengthen risk and controls processes and continued remediation effort, including returning cash to investors following the supply chain finance funds issue. ""Our clear focus remains on the disciplined execution of our new Group strategy as announced in November 2021: strengthening our core and simplifying our organization as we look to invest for growth in key strategic business areas,"" Gottstein added. Gottstein took the helm in early 2020 after former CEO Tidjane Thiam resigned following a bizarre and protracted spying scandal that rocked Switzerland's second-largest bank to its foundations. Other highlights from Thursday's earnings: Speaking to CNBC on Thursday, Gottstein said 2022 will be a transitional year for the bank as it navigates its restructure, technological changes, exit of its prime brokerage business, and uncertainty around inflation, central bank policy, Covid-19 and geopolitical tensions. ""These will all be steps that we see the benefit coming through over time, but not in the short term, so '22 is a transition year for the firm,"" he said. Asked about how the bank can assuage shareholder concerns about the string of scandals in recent years, Gottstein said implementing the new strategy was central. ""We want to operate the bank as a stronger bank, we have a stronger capital base, we have 14.4% CET1 ratio and 6.2% tier one leverage ratio, one of the strongest in the whole peer group,"" he said. ""So we are very well positioned now in terms of balance sheet, but we now have to implement the strategy, and that's really what [the shareholders] want to hear."" Andrea Enria, chair of the European Central Bank supervisory board, told CNBC on Thursday that while increasing interest rates and rising growth should be positive for banks in the coming years, a bumpy exit caused by ""highly leveraged, highly concentrated"" segments of the market poses a risk. ""Following the Archegos case, we have been focusing more on the prime brokerage segment. We are planning on-site inspections in that area. We have asked banks to strengthen their controls, their risk management controls in that area,"" Enria said. Along with its reduced risk appetite, Credit Suisse also said that a return to a ""more normal trading environment"" after the exceptional conditions of the Covid pandemic had impacted net revenues, which were down 12% year-on-year in the fourth quarter. ""This was most evident in the Investment Bank, largely due to our exit of Prime Services and the strong comparable performance in 4Q20, but our Wealth Management-related businesses also saw a reduction in transaction-based revenues,"" it said. Credit Suisse's wealth management-related businesses posted an 8% decline in net revenues year-on-year due to lower transaction and performance-based revenues, which fell 25%. The bank attributed this in large part to reduced revenues at its global trading solutions division, lower client activity and lower net interest income, which fell 5% annually.

"From Credit Suisse to Goldman Sachs, investment banks say it's time to buy Chinese stocks","More and more international investment analysts say it's time to buy mainland Chinese stocks, ahead of expected government support for growth.Bernstein and Goldman Sachs, in particular, have released thick reports on the investability of Chinese shares.However, not all investment analysts are as optimistic. Morgan Stanley, Bank of America and J.P. Morgan Asset Management are neutral on mainland China.","BEIJING — More and more international investment analysts say it's time to buy mainland Chinese stocks, ahead of expected government support for growth. On top of the pandemic's drag on the economy, heightened regulatory uncertainty since last summer has generally kept foreign investors cautious on Chinese stocks. But that's starting to change for some investment firms in the last several months. In its global stock strategy report for 2022, Credit Suisse upgraded China to ""overweight,"" reversing a downgrade of the stocks about 12 months ago. ""Monetary policy is being eased [in China] while elsewhere it is being tightened,"" its global strategist Andrew Garthwaite and his team wrote in the late January report. ""Economic momentum is turning up."" One of the early positive turns on mainland Chinese stocks came from BlackRock Investment Institute in late September. As 2022 got underway, other firms also made similar calls, while others remain neutral. On the political front, Credit Suisse expects regulatory uncertainty to subside after a national parliamentary meeting in March, and remain muted — at least until after the ruling Chinese Communist Party's 20th National Congress in the fourth quarter. Chinese President Xi Jinping is widely expected to take on an unprecedented third term at the meeting, which occurs every five years to select top government leaders. During a December economic planning meeting for 2022, Chinese officials emphasized the need for stability. Financial factors, such as how much the stocks have fallen compared to their potential ability to deliver earnings, also contribute to analysts' positive turn on Chinese stocks. In January, Bernstein released a 172-page report titled ""Chinese Equities: 'Uninvestable' No More."" ""We believe there is a case to add back China exposure to global portfolios due to six key reasons,"" analysts at the investment research firm said. They pointed to expectations for growth in new financing, easier monetary policy and more attractive stock valuations relative to the rest of the world. Other factors included a rare opportunity to pick stocks, growing foreign inflows and increased earnings. The Shanghai composite has climbed 2% since the Lunar New Year holiday, which was from Jan. 31 to Feb. 6 this year.

""Investors are too bearish about China stocks,"" HSBC analysts wrote in a Feb. 7 report that affirmed its call in October to upgrade Chinese stocks to overweight.

Even good, blue chip stocks are now trading at attractive valuations."" The bank's analysts forecast 9.2% gains this year for the Shanghai composite, and 15.6% for the Shenzhen component index. Goldman Sachs forecasts 16% in gains for the MSCI China index this year as valuations remain below the Wall Street bank's target of a 14.5 price-to-earnings ratio, its chief China Equity Strategist Kinger Lau said in a Jan. 23 report.

In late October, UBS announced it was upgrading Chinese stocks to ""overweight,"" up two notches from an ""underweight"" call in the summer of 2020. In another sign of the firm's optimism, the emerging markets strategy team said in January its highest-conviction stock ideas include many Chinese internet names like Alibaba that have been the target of Beijing's new regulation on alleged monopolistic practices and data security. However, not all international investment firms are as optimistic. Morgan Stanley's Asia emerging markets stock strategy team is neutral on mainland China, as are Bank of America and J.P.

While there are investment opportunities within certain sectors, she expects corporate earnings growth across China to decelerate. Wu pointed out that in 2016, despite expectations of stimulus, stocks only began to climb after the second quarter. The Shanghai composite closed 12.3% lower that year. A sell-off in mainland shares so far this year reflects how investors have generally remained cautious on Chinese stocks.

The Swiss bank has denied any wrongdoing and said it ""strongly rejects"" the allegations published by dozens of global media outlets following a coordinated investigation. The leak of client data was initially sent to a German newspaper before being picked up by the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project and 46 other news organizations. Credit Suisse said the ensuing report, entitled ""Suisse Secrets,"" detailed ""predominantly historical"" matters and was based on ""partial, inaccurate, or selective information taken out of context, resulting in tendentious interpretations of the bank's business conduct."" ""Approximately 90% of the reviewed accounts are today closed or were in the process of closure prior to receipt of the press inquiries, of which over 60% were closed before 2015. Swiss regulator FINMA said it was aware of the articles, though couldn't comment on individual media reports. ""We can confirm that we are in contact with the bank in this context. Compliance with money laundering regulations has been a focus of our supervisory activities for years now. We refer to FINMA's measures and procedures in the context of combating money laundering in recent years,"" FINMA added. Meanwhile, the European People's Party (EPP) — the conservative grouping commanding the largest number of seats in the European Parliament — on Monday urged the European Commission to ""re-evaluate Switzerland as a high-risk money-laundering country,"" suggesting it could be included on the EU's blacklist for countries notorious for laundering dirty money. ""The 'Swiss Secrets' findings point to massive shortcomings of Swiss banks when it comes to the prevention of money laundering,"" said Markus Ferber, the EPPs coordinator on economic affairs. ""When Swiss banks fail to apply international anti-money laundering standards properly, Switzerland itself becomes a high-risk jurisdiction."" In its recent earnings report and in the aftermath of the resignation of its former chairman Antonio Horta-Osorio – who was found to have broken Covid-19 quarantine rules on multiple occasions – Switzerland's second-largest bank had emphasized focus on overhauling its corporate culture. The bank was burned badly by litigation costs in the fourth quarter of 2021 as the fallout continued over its involvement with collapsed U.S. hedge fund Archegos Capital and insolvent supply chain finance company Greensill. This resulted in Credit Suisse setting aside ""major litigation provisions of 1.1 billion Swiss francs ($1.2 billion) and posting a full-year net loss of 1.57 billion Swiss francs for 2021. Credit Suisse also recently became the first Swiss bank to answer criminal charges and faces a court case involving millions of euros in alleged money laundering for drug gangs between 2004 and 2008. A banker accused of money laundering told the court last week that Credit Suisse learned of murders and cocaine trafficking allegedly linked to a Bulgarian mafia organization, but proceeded to manage the cash in question. Both the banker and Credit Suisse deny any wrongdoing. In October 2021, FINMA concluded an investigation into a number of legacy anti-money laundering issues dating back decades before 2014, and some between 2016 and 2019. The regulator imposed measures on the group and continues to track their implementation. Scandals have plagued Credit Suisse for years. Former CEO Tidjane Thiam resigned in early 2020 after a bizarre spying saga that also resulted in the death of a contractor and the ousting of its COO Pierre-Olivier Bouee. Horta-Osorio was brought in to right the ship with regards to corporate culture, only to be forced to step down himself. CEO Thomas Gottstein told CNBC following the bank's latest earnings report that righting risk management and controls was a top priority following a ""challenging year."" Credit Suisse stock is already down more than 9.5% year-to-date and trades at a discount compared to its peers, at around 0.47% of the sector average in Europe. DBRS Morningstar, which covers Credit Suisse stock, told CNBC on Monday that the recent news ""highlights additional risk management shortcomings at Credit Suisse, including anti money laundering procedures and lack of internal controls and management accountability."" ""We consider the news adds to the significant failures observed in 2021 and point to extremely weak risk management and controls at the Group level and across the different businesses, to now include Wealth Management, after the Archegos issue in the Investment bank and the Supply Fund Chains issue in Asset Management,"" Maria Rivas, senior vice president of financial institutions at DBRS Morningstar, told CNBC. ""This is another hit for CSG and the new Chairman and management team, who are trying to make a clean start and announced a 2022 transition year to restore confidence and improve risk management."" Rivas suggested that despite new leadership's focus on overhauling the bank's risk culture and controls, these changes could ""take years to materialize"" given the complexity and scale of the group's global structure. ""Also, there could be further implications for CSG if this is considered a breach of Swiss banking secrecy under the Swiss Banking Act article 47, as it is a federal crime to disclose the information or activity of clients banking domestically to foreign entities,"" she added.",2022-02-22 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/02/22/credit-suisse-faces-fresh-scrutiny-over-culture-after-client-data-leaks.html?&qsearchterm=,10,0,867,"-1.

The Swiss bank is under investigation by the House Oversight Committee over allegations that it asked investors to ""destroy and permanently erase"" documents related to a portfolio of loans backed by yachts and private jets potentially owned by sanctioned Russian oligarchs. Credit Suisse allegedly sent the request to investors following a report first surfaced by the Financial Times that it had offloaded the risks relating to $2 billion of loans to a group of hedge funds. CEO Thomas Gottstein said Wednesday that the letter received by investors had ""nothing to do"" with sanctions or loans belonging to members of President Vladimir Putin's inner circle. ""[It] has nothing to do with destroying materials related to sanctions,"" Gottstein told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore. ""This was a one-off transaction, which was very much a continuation of three other securitized transactions we did before,"" he said. ""It was part of our dealing with private placement investors, institutional investors, and there were absolutely no materials in there that were relevant from a sanctions perspective."" Asked whether the bank had any case to answer, Gottstein said, ""absolutely not."" According to the FT, the request letters were sent during a week in which the U.S., U.K. and EU launched a fresh wave of sanctions against Russia over its unprovoked invasion of Ukraine. Gottstein also defended the bank's position on Russian business, saying that like other major Wall Street and European banks it was scaling back its operations there in the wake of the war. ""As everybody else, we are winding down our Russia business,"" he said, reiterating an announcement made last month. Going forward, Gottstein said the bank would not be taking on ""any new business, any new clients"" from Russia, while also continuing to wind down its exposure to existing Russian clients. ""Our total exposure to Russian clients — that includes Russian clients all over the world, not only the Russian clients in Russia — and we have been reducing this by 56% in terms of our credit exposure,"" he said. The remarks follow the release of Credit Suisse's first-quarter financial results Wednesday, in which it reported a net loss of 273 million Swiss francs ($283.5 million). Russia-related losses accounted for 206 million francs of the losses, while the bank also took a hit of 155 million francs related to the Archegos scandal. Gottstein has previously stated that about 4% of the assets the bank manages in its core wealth management business belong to Russian clients. ""We have roughly 4% of our assets under management in wealth management with Russian clients, be they Russian-domiciled or Russian nationals who live in the West,"" Gottstein said, according to Reuters.

Credit Suisse vowed to ramp up its efforts to overhaul the group's structure in the wake of mounting losses and a string of scandals — most notably the Archegos hedge fund collapse — that have resulted in substantial litigation costs. Speculation has emerged in recent months that Credit Suisse may be considering a capital raise and even a possible sale of the company, but Lehmann told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore Wednesday that neither was in the cards.

He told CNBC on Wednesday that Gottstein was ""a great guy"" who did a ""great job,"" but that two key changes had arisen since that conversation at the World Economic Forum in Davos. ""First, we embarked on a thorough strategy review and we announced today that we are speeding up our transformation, and Thomas has decided that at that point of time, also for personal reasons, it is better to do a change,"" Lehmann said, adding that Gottstein was ""instrumental"" in developing the strategic review. ""He stands fully behind it, but at a certain point of time, you need to have the full energy, and I think at that point, he and I felt it is better to change and bring in somebody like an Ulrich Koerner, who has, I think, a great track record on operational transformation."" Koerner, a Credit Suisse veteran, will take over as CEO with immediate effect, and Lehmann said that on one hand, his appointment represents a ""continuation"" of the transformation efforts that began under Gottstein. ""[Koerner] knows banking inside out. He was building businesses, he was COO in large organizations, so he has a truly front to back, and I call it, a back to front, approach,"" Lehmann said. ""He will take over with immediate effect and he will drive the transformation that we will speed up."" The investment bank was hit by significantly lower capital markets issuance activity and reduced client activity, Credit Suisse said in a summary on Wednesday, acknowledging that the division's positioning ""was not geared towards benefiting from the volatile market conditions"" and its areas of strength, such as capital markets, were ""significantly impacted."" A 29% annual decline in group net revenue was driven primarily by a 43% fall in investment banking revenues and a 34% slide in wealth management revenues, while asset management revenues also fell 25%. ""In the Investment Bank, while we have a robust pipeline of transactions, these may prove difficult to execute in the current market environment,"" Credit Suisse warned in its report. ""Trading so far in 3Q22 has been marked by a continued weakness in client activity, exacerbating normal seasonal declines, and we would expect this division to report a further loss this quarter."" Operating expenses climbed 10% year-on-year and included major litigation provisions of 434 million Swiss francs relating to multiple legal matters. Wednesday's dismal earnings report comes on the back of a net loss of 273 million Swiss francs in the first quarter, as Russia-related losses and continued litigation costs arising from the Archegos hedge fund scandal dented the bank's income. In the second quarter of 2021, Credit Suisse's net income reached 253 million Swiss francs, a 78% drop from the previous year, after taking a 4.4 billion franc loss following the collapse of Archegos. The Archegos saga led to the departure of Credit Suisse's investment bank chief and chief risk and compliance officer, and was preceded by a separate shakeup in the asset management division in the wake of the collapse of British supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital. Credit Suisse ran $10 billion in funds tied to Greensill. Maria Rivas, senior vice president for global financial institutions at DBRS Morningstar, highlighted that the second-quarter's losses were equivalent to the full-year's losses in 2021, when results were negatively affected by the Archegos writedown, higher litigation costs and a goodwill impairment. ""Similar to Q1 2022, the Q2 2022 Pre Tax Loss continued to be negatively impacted by high litigation provisions, losses from its equity investment in Allfunds, and restructuring costs (CHF 80 million),"" Rivas said in an email Wednesday. ""However, the uncertain economic environment and market volatility also negatively impacted Q2 results through marked to market losses on leverage finance exposures and significantly lower revenues from capital markets. And this negative impact is likely to continue in coming quarters, triggering the deeper strategic review announced today."" Credit Suisse warned early in June that it was likely to post a loss for the quarter, citing the deteriorating geopolitical situation, aggressive monetary policy tightening from central banks and the unwinding of Covid-19 era stimulus measures. The bank said at the time that this confluence of adverse conditions had caused ""continued heightened market volatility, weak customer flows and ongoing client deleveraging, notably in the APAC region."" Despite the challenging backdrop, Credit Suisse vowed at an Investor Deep Dive event in late June to forge ahead with its risk management and compliance overhaul, which was launched following a string of scandals and aims to reform its risk, compliance, technology and operations functions, along with the wealth management business. Other highlights: The bank also faces a potential $600 million hit from a court case in Bermuda relating to its local life insurance arm, as legacy scandals continue to hammer its balance sheet. Gottstein's departure is the latest in a string of senior management changes at the bank, and aside from other management changes announced in the investment bank to support the reshaping of the business, Lehmann indicated on Wednesday that no more major changes were on the horizon. DBRS Morningstar's Rivas said the change in CEO ""completes the full management overhaul needed to restore confidence after 2021 events."" ""In the last 15 months, there have been significant management changes at board level and business level but the CEO was part of the management team prior to Archegos and Supply Chain Finance issues,"" she said.

Credit Suisse is set to report second-quarter results on Wednesday, and it has already warned investors that it will lose money. The bank blamed worsening economic conditions in Europe and Asia for the loss. Gottstein, a two-decade veteran of Credit Suisse, took over in early 2020 from predecessor Tidjane Thiam, who resigned after a spying scandal. Gottstein was soon wrestling with the costly fallout from the meltdown of two key clients: the Archegos family office and supply-chain finance firm Greensill.

Credit Suisse hit with stock and credit downgrades after earnings plunge,"Credit Suiise shares are down more than 42% year-to-date, as new CEO Ulrich Koerner takes the reins following the resignation of Thomas Gottstein last week. Moody's on Monday downgraded Credit Suisse's senior unsecured debt and deposit ratings by one notch and maintained a negative outlook on the bank's credit trajectory.S&P Global Ratings on Monday revised its outlook on Credit Suisse to negative, citing increasing risks to the stability of the bank's franchise, uncertainty around the reshuffling of top executives, and a ""lack of a clear strategy,"" along with continued weak profitability over the medium term. ","Credit Suisse shares slipped on Wednesday after Goldman Sachs downgraded the stock to ""sell"" following credit rating downgrades from Moody's and S&P. The embattled Swiss lender's shares were down slightly by early afternoon trade in London, having recouped some of their earlier losses, and remain down more than 42% year-to-date, as new CEO Ulrich Koerner takes the reins following the resignation of Thomas Gottstein last week.  The bank announced a new strategic review after reporting a second-quarter net loss of 1.593 billion Swiss francs ($1.66 billion), well below consensus, as poor investment bank performance and mounting litigation provisions hammered earnings. Goldman Sachs noted on Tuesday that Credit Suisse has underperformed the rest of the sector by 59% since the start of 2021, due to company-specific events and industry-wide obstacles to revenue. The Wall Street giant expects this underperformance to continue over the next 12 months as investment bank returns remain suppressed through to 2024, and projected a pause in near-term wealth management performance due to outflows and subdued market performance. ""On capital, while we foresee no near-term shortfall, organic capital generation is below peers and RWA (risk-weighted assets), inflation plus litigation plus restructuring has the potential to further deplete capital to a relatively low buffer vs regulatory minimums,"" Executive Director Chris Hallam and his team said in Tuesday's note. Despite the more favorable picture Goldman sees across the European banking space — in which higher interest rates will boost revenue and returns forecasts, reinvestment in new technology will enhance returns, and excess capital can be distributed to shareholders — Credit Suisse is valued roughly in line with the sector at present. ""Our revised 12-month price target implies 5% upside, but in the context of c.60% upside on average across our Banks coverage, this equates to meaningful underperformance: accordingly, we downgrade the stock to Sell from Neutral,"" Goldman said. Moody's on Monday downgraded Credit Suisse's senior unsecured debt and deposit ratings by one notch and maintained a negative outlook on the bank's credit trajectory. ""The downgrade of CS's ratings reflects the challenges the group is facing in successfully executing on its previously announced repositioning of its investment bank in the more difficult macroeconomic and market environment as well as uncertainty as to the business and financial implications of the group's plans to take further steps to achieve a more stable, capital light and better aligned investment banking business,"" Moody's said in its update. The ratings agency also cited ""the crystallisation of large financial losses during H1 2022, resulting in stress on the bank's financial profile and potential delays in technology investments, and in the transformation of the business and an expectation of continued weak performance in 2022."" Furthermore, Moody's highlighted evidence of an erosion of Credit Suisse's market share and ""franchise impairment"" in its investment bank, following deleveraging in its capital-intensive businesses and exit from its prime brokerage business. The ongoing overhaul of its risk and compliance operations is ""lengthy and resource-consuming,"" while stabilizing the group under new leadership and a fresh senior executive team will take time, Moody's said. ""These factors are partially mitigated by the firm's solid – although decreasing – capitalisation and strong liquidity and funding profiles,"" it added. Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann told CNBC last week that the new strategic review will look to accelerate restructuring efforts.  The review will aim to drastically reduce the group's cost base, strengthen its wealth management, Swiss banking and asset management operations, and transform the investment bank into a capital-light, advisory-led banking business with a greater focus on markets. However, Moody's cited uncertainty over the bank's ""ability to successfully execute"" on the ""as yet to be defined"" restructuring strategy, along with ""governance deficiencies and top management instability,"" in a one-notch downgrade for corporate behavior on Credit Suisse's scorecard. S&P Global Ratings on Monday revised its outlook on Credit Suisse to negative, citing increasing risks to the stability of the bank's franchise, uncertainty around the reshuffling of top executives, and a ""lack of a clear strategy,"" along with continued weak profitability over the medium term.  ""The negative outlook reflects the setbacks Credit Suisse could face in redesigning its strategy, with new management at the helm, in order to transform the bank in an increasingly difficult operating environment,"" S&P said.",2022-08-03 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/08/03/credit-suisse-hit-with-stock-and-credit-downgrades-after-earnings-plunge.html?&qsearchterm=,9,1,708,"-1.

Credit Suisse to remain 'under pressure' but analysts wary of Lehman comparison,"Credit Suisse shares continued to recover on Tuesday from the previous session's low of 3.60 Swiss francs ($3.64), but were still down more than 53% on the year. The embattled lender is embarking on a massive strategic review under a new CEO following a string of scandals and risk management failures, and will give a progress update alongside its quarterly earnings on Oct. 27.","In this article Credit Suisse shares briefly sank to an all-time low this week while credit default swaps hit a record high, as the market's skittishness about the Swiss bank's future became abundantly clear. The shares continued to recover Tuesday from the previous session's low of 3.60 Swiss francs ($3.64), but were still down more than 53% on the year. The embattled lender is embarking on a massive strategic review under a new CEO after a string of scandals and risk management failures, and will give a progress update alongside its quarterly earnings on Oct. 27. Credit Suisse credit default swaps — derivatives that serve as a kind of insurance contract against a company defaulting on its debt — soared to a spread of more than 300 basis points Monday, well above that of the rest of the sector. Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Koerner last week sought to reassure staff of the Swiss bank's ""strong capital base and liquidity position"" amid market concerns and a rise in credit default swaps. In an internal memo sent to staff last week, Koerner promised them regular updates during this ""challenging period"" and said Credit Suisse was ""well on track"" with its strategic review. ""I know it's not easy to remain focused amid the many stories you read in the media — in particular, given the many factually inaccurate statements being made. That said, I trust that you are not confusing our day-to-day stock price performance with the strong capital base and liquidity position of the bank,"" Koerner said. Based on Credit Suisse's weaker return on equity profile compared with its European investment banking peers, U.S. investment research company CFRA on Monday lowered its price target for the stock to 3.50 Swiss francs per share, down from 4.50 francs. This reflects a price-to-book ratio of 0.2 times versus a European investment bank average of 0.44 times, CFRA equity analyst Firdaus Ibrahim said in a note Monday. CFRA also lowered its earnings per share forecasts to -0.30 francs from -0.20 francs for 2022, and to 0.60 francs from 0.65 francs for 2023. A price-to-book ratio measures the market value of a company's stock against its book value of equity, while earnings per share divides a company's profit by the outstanding shares of its common stock. ""The many options rumored to be considered by CS, including exit of U.S. investment banking, creation of a 'bad bank' to hold risky assets, and capital raise, indicate a huge overhaul is needed to turn around the bank, in our view,"" Ibrahim said. ""We believe that the negative sentiment surrounding the stock will not abate any time soon and believe its share price will continue to be under pressure. A convincing restructuring plan will help, but we remain skeptical, given its poor track record of delivering on past restructuring plans."" Despite the general market negativity toward its stock, Credit Suisse is only the eighth-most shorted European bank, with 2.42% of its floated shares used to bet against it as of Monday, according to data analytics firm S3 Partners. All three major credit ratings agencies — Moody's, S&P and Fitch — now have a negative outlook on Credit Suisse, and Johann Scholtz, equity analyst at Morningstar, told CNBC Tuesday that this was likely driving the widening of CDS spreads. He noted that Credit Suisse is a ""very well capitalized bank"" and that capitalization is ""at worst in line with peers,"" but the key danger would be a situation akin to that experienced by well-capitalized banks during the 2008 financial crisis, where customers were reluctant to deal with financial institutions for fear of a domino effect and counterparty risk. ""Banks being highly leveraged entities are exposed much more to sentiment of clients and most importantly to providers of funding, and that's the challenge for Credit Suisse to thread that delicate path between addressing the interests of providers of, especially, wholesale funding, and then also the interests of equity investors,"" Scholtz said. ""I think a lot of investors will make the point about why does the bank need to raise capital if solvency is not a concern? But it's really to address the negative sentiment and very much the issue ... in terms of the perception of counterparties."" Scholtz dismissed the idea that a ""Lehman moment"" could be on the horizon for Credit Suisse, pointing to the fact that markets knew that there were ""serious issues"" with the Lehman Brothers balance sheet in the run-up to the 2008 crisis, and that ""serious write-downs"" were needed. ""Whilst there is a potential for new write-downs being announced by Credit Suisse at the end of the month when they're coming up with results, there is nothing publicly available at the moment that indicates that those write-downs will be sufficient to actually cause solvency issues for Credit Suisse,"" Scholtz said. ""The other thing that is much different compared to the great financial crisis – and that's not just the case only for Credit Suisse – is that not only are their equity capital levels much higher, you've also seen a complete overhaul of the structure of banking capitalization, something like buy-inable debt that's come along, also improves the outlook for the solvency of banks."" The bank's share price is down more than 73% over the past five years, and such a dramatic plunge has naturally led to market speculation about consolidation, while some of the market chatter ahead of the Oct. 27 announcement has focused on a possible hiving off of the troublesome investment banking business and capital markets operation. However, he contended that there is ""still a lot of value"" in Credit Suisse in terms of the sum of its parts. ""Its wealth management business is still a decent business, and if you look at the kind of multiples that its peers – especially stand-alone wealth management peers – trade at, then you can make a very strong case for some deep value in the name,"" he added. Scholtz dismissed the notion of consolidation of Credit Suisse with domestic rival UBS on the basis that the Swiss regulator would be unlikely to greenlight it, and also suggested that a sale of the investment bank would be difficult to pull off. ""The challenge is that in the current environment, you don't really want to be a seller if you're Credit Suisse. The market knows you are under pressure, so to try and sell an investment banking business in the current circumstance is going to be very challenging,"" he said. ""The other thing is that while it might address concerns around risk, it's very unlikely that they're going to sell this business for anything close to a profit, so you're not going to raise capital by disposing of this business.""",2022-10-06 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/04/credit-suisse-to-remain-under-pressure-but-analysts-wary-of-lehman-comparison.html?&qsearchterm=,16,1,1122,"-1.

Credit Suisse shares plunge 18% as bank announces huge third-quarter loss and strategic overhaul,"Credit Suisse has been plagued by sluggish investment banking revenues, losses relating to its business in Russia and litigation costs following a host of legacy compliance and risk management failures, most notably the Archegos hedge fund scandal.The embattled lender posted a third-quarter net loss of 4.034 billion Swiss francs ($4.09 billion), compared with analyst expectations for a loss of 567.93 million Swiss francs. The figure is also well below the 434 million Swiss franc profit posted for the same quarter last year.","Credit Suisse shares plunged 18% on Thursday after the Swiss bank posted a quarterly loss that was significantly worse than analyst estimates, and announced a massive strategic overhaul. The embattled lender posted a third-quarter net loss of 4.034 billion Swiss francs ($4.09 billion), compared to analyst expectations for a loss of 567.93 million Swiss francs. The figure was also well below the 434 million Swiss franc profit posted for the same quarter last year. The bank noted that the loss reflected a 3.655 billion Swiss franc impairment relating to the ""reassessment of deferred tax assets as a result of the comprehensive strategic review."" Under pressure from investors, the bank revealed a major overhaul of its business in a bid to address underperformance in its investment bank and following a raft of litigation costs that have hammered earnings. New CEO Ulrich Koerner told CNBC on Thursday it represented the beginning of a ""transformation into a new Credit Suisse."" In its widely anticipated strategic shift, the bank vowed to ""radically restructure"" its investment bank to significantly cut its exposure to risk-weighted assets, which are used to determine a bank's capital requirements. It also aims to cut its cost base by 15%, or 2.5 billion Swiss francs, by 2025. The bank expects to incur restructuring charges of 2.9 billion Swiss francs by the end of 2024. The transformation plan will see Credit Suisse split off its investment bank into an independent business called CS First Boston, raise 4 billion Swiss franc in capital through the issuance of new shares and a rights offering, and create a capital release unit to wind down lower-return, non-strategic businesses. Of the planned 4 billion Swiss franc capital raise, the bank revealed that 1.5 billion Swiss francs will come from the Saudi National Bank in exchange for a shareholding of up to 9.9%. The aim is to reduce risk-weighted assets and leverage exposure by 40% each over the course of the restructure, while the bank also set out to allocate ""almost 80% of capital to Wealth Management, Swiss Bank, Asset Management and Markets by 2025."" Speaking to CNBC, Koerner said the bank will be ""much more stable, will be sustainably profitable, much simpler in how it is set up, and for us, one of the most important things was how did we come to that solution? We started actually with the client needs and we designed everything around the client needs and ended up with what we are proposing today.""  Koerner took the helm in July following the resignation of predecessor Thomas Gottstein, after the bank booked a second-quarter net loss of 1.593 billion Swiss francs, far below consensus expectations among analysts. He said Thursday's strategic overhaul represented a ""very decisive action program."" ""Number one, a radical restructure of the investment bank; number two, a significant reduction of costs; and number three, a further strengthening of our capital base, and I think with that, we have all the necessary ingredients ... to go where we want to go,"" he added. Credit Suisse has been plagued over the past year by sluggish investment banking revenues, losses from the withdrawal of its business in Russia and litigation costs relating to a host of legacy compliance and risk management failures, most notably the Archegos hedge fund scandal. Here are some other financial highlights for the third quarter: Vitaline Yeterian, senior vice president for global financial institutions at DBRS Morningstar, said the scale of the third-quarter loss was indicative of the stress Credit Suisse had suffered in its core business. ""Both in Q3 and 9M 2022, total revenues were below operating costs and well below peers in its core investment banking and wealth management businesses,"" she said. ""The main drivers were much lower commissions and fees due to lower client activity, as well as lower trading revenues due to a drop in capital markets revenues. Meanwhile total net interest income was also down YOY (in Q3 and over 9M)."" The bank also saw an outflow of deposits and assets under management, which it attributed in part to reputational harm resulting from the Archegos and Greensill Capital sagas, along with a spike in withdrawals earlier this month following what the bank called ""negative press and social media coverage based on incorrect rumors."" Yeterian said the rejuvenation of the CS First Boston brand could ""help to disconnect the IB from the repeated negative press coverage CS has been subject to."" ""We clearly see execution risks for the restructuring — in particular considering the challenging economic and geopolitical backdrops,"" she added. ""The CET1 ratio was 12.6% at end-Q3 2022, down 90 bps vs end-June 2022. The capital increase will clearly provide some room to execute CS's plan, although it is not fully secured.""",2022-10-27 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2022/10/27/credit-suisse-results-and-strategy-q3-2022-earnings-and-overhaul.html?&qsearchterm=,5,4,788,"-1.

The SNB chairman cited Credit Suisse's investment banking unit as the Achilles' heel of the company, accentuated by the current climate of increased market volatility.

""So it's just moving back into a very stable, conservative Swiss banking posture, which we like,"" he said. In the short to medium-term outlook, Alkhudairy said he feels that the most important step for Credit Suisse to undertake is to ""get the volatile business out of the quarterly earnings,"" and focus on private wealth management and augment the retail business. ""I just would urge them not to blink, not to hesitate and just execute [the overhaul]. The quicker the better,"" he said. The investment comes on the heels of Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's encouragement of Saudi Arabia's largest firms to actively invest overseas and bolster its profile as a global investor.

Credit Suisse's capital raising plans are split into two parts. The first, which was backed by 92% of shareholders, grants shares to new investors including the Saudi National Bank via a private placement. The new share offering will see the SNB take a 9.9% stake in Credit Suisse, making it the bank's largest shareholder.

The second capital increase issues newly registered shares with pre-emptive rights to existing shareholders, and passed with 98% of the vote. Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann said the vote marked an ""important step"" in the building of ""the new Credit Suisse."" ""This vote confirms confidence in the strategy, as we presented it in October, and we are fully focused on delivering our strategic priorities to lay the foundation for future profitable growth,"" Lehmann said. Credit Suisse on Wednesday projected a 1.5 billion Swiss franc ($1.6 billion) loss for the fourth quarter as it begins its second strategic overhaul in less than a year, aimed at simplifying its business model to focus on its wealth management division and Swiss domestic market. The restructuring plans include the sale of part of the bank's securitized products group (SPG) to U.S. investment houses PIMCO and Apollo Global Management, as well as a downsizing of its struggling investment bank through a spin-off of the capital markets and advisory unit, which will be rebranded as CS First Boston. The multi-year transformation aims to shift billions of dollars of risk-weighted assets from the persistently underperforming investment bank to the wealth management and domestic divisions, and to reduce the group's cost base by 2.5 billion, or 15%, by 2025. Vincent Kaufman, CEO of the Ethos Foundation, which represents hundreds of Swiss pension funds that are active shareholders in Credit Suisse, voiced disappointment ahead of Wednesday's vote that the group was no longer considering a partial IPO of the Swiss domestic bank, which he said would have ""sent a stronger message to the market."" Despite the dilution of shares, Kaufman said the Ethos Foundation would support the issuance of new shares to existing shareholders as part of the capital raise, but opposed the private placement for new investors, primarily the SNB. ""The capital increase without pre-emptive rights in favor of new investors exceed our dilution limits set in our voting guidelines. I discussed with several of our members, and they all agree that the dilution there is too high,"" he said. ""We do favor the part of the capital increase with preemptive rights, still believing that the potential partial IPO of the Swiss division would have also been a possibility to raise capital without having to dilute at such a level existing shareholders, so we are not favoring this first part of the capital increase without pre-emptive rights."" At Credit Suisse's annual general meeting in April, the Ethos Foundation tabled a shareholder resolution on climate strategy, and Kaufman said he was concerned about the direction this would take under the bank's new major shareholders.

The embattled lender last month announced a raft of measures to address persistent underperformance in its investment bank and a series of risk and compliance failures that have saddled it with consistently high litigation costs. ""These decisive measures are expected to result in a radical restructuring of the Investment Bank, an accelerated cost transformation, and strengthened and reallocated capital, each of which are progressing at pace,"" the bank said in a market update on Wednesday. Credit Suisse revealed that it had continued to experience net asset outflows, and said these flows were approximately 6% of assets under management at the end of the third quarter. The Zurich-based bank flagged last month that this trend continued in the first two weeks of October, after reports cast doubt over its liquidity position and credit default swaps spiked. Credit default swaps are a type of financial derivative that provide the buyer with protection against default.  ""In wealth management, these outflows have reduced substantially from the elevated levels of the first two weeks of October 2022 although have not yet reversed,"" Credit Suisse said Wednesday. The group expects to record a 75 million Swiss franc loss related to the sale of its shareholding in British wealth tech platform Allfunds group, while lower deposits and reduced assets under management are expected to lead to a fall in net interest income, recurring commissions and fees, which the bank said is likely to lead to a loss for its wealth management division in the fourth quarter. ""Together with the adverse revenue impact from the previously disclosed exit from the non-core businesses and exposures, and as previously announced on October 27, 2022, Credit Suisse would expect the Investment Bank and the Group to report a substantial loss before taxes in the fourth quarter 2022, of up to CHF ~1.5 billion for the Group,"" the bank said.

Koerner said the transformation towards a ""new Credit Suisse"" was going well. ""We laid out a very clear plan, and we talked to all different stakeholder groups in the last three months, as you would expect,"" he said. ""I think the plan, the strategy resonates very much. We are in full execution swing, so I think we are making really good progress."" Credit Suisse has also reached out to tens of thousands of clients in Switzerland and around the world for feedback, Koerner said. ""That has generated very positive momentum, and I think this is momentum that travels with us through 2023,"" he added. Koerner confirmed that the reported departure of 10% of Credit Suisse's investment bankers in Europe was part of its previously announced plans to cut 2,700 jobs by 2023 and reduce headcount by a total 9,000 by 2025. As part of the overhaul, Credit Suisse will spin off and rebrand its U.S. investment banking division as CS First Boston. The new unit will be headed by former Credit Suisse board member Michael Klein. Credit Suisse is reportedly on the verge of buying Klein's boutique investment advisory firm. Koerner insisted that he had ""zero concerns"" about conflicts of interest, stressing that the bank could deal with the situation ""in the utmost professional way.""

The lender's fourth-quarter net loss attributable to shareholders came in at 1.4 billion Swiss francs ($1.51 billion), worse than analyst projections of a loss 1.32 billion Swiss francs, according to Eikon. It took the embattled Swiss lender's full-year loss to 7.3 billion Swiss francs, worse than the 6.53 billion Swiss franc loss expectation by analysts. Shares were down 14% on Thursday afternoon. Credit Suisse is telegraphing another ""substantial"" full-year loss in 2023 before returning to profitability in 2024. CEO Ulrich Koerner told CNBC on Thursday that the full results were ""completely unacceptable,"" but underscored the need for the ongoing multi-year transformation program. Under pressure from investors, the bank in October announced a plan to simplify and transform its business in an effort to return to stable profitability following chronic underperformance in its investment bank and a litany of risk and compliance failures. Koerner in a statement accompanying results that 2022 was a ""crucial year for Credit Suisse"" and that it had been ""executing at pace"" on its strategic plan to create a ""simpler, more focused bank."" ""We successfully raised CHF ~4 billion in equity capital, accelerated the delivery of our ambitious cost targets, and are making strong progress on the radical restructuring of our Investment Bank,"" he said in the statement. ""We have a clear plan to create a new Credit Suisse and intend to continue to deliver on our three-year strategic transformation by reshaping our portfolio, reallocating capital, right-sizing our cost base, and building on our leading franchises."" In November, the bank projected a 1.5 billion Swiss franc loss for the fourth quarter amid large-scale restructuring costs, while Credit Suisse shareholders greenlit a $4.2 billion capital raise aimed at financing the overhaul. The capital raise included the sale of 9.9% of Credit Suisse shares to the Saudi National Bank, making it the bank's largest shareholder. The Qatar Investment Authority became the second-largest shareholder in Credit Suisse after doubling its stake late last year. Reports of liquidity concerns led Credit Suisse to experience significant outflows of assets under management in late 2022, but Koerner told CNBC at the World Economic Forum in January that the bank had seen a sharp reduction in outflows, and that money was now coming back to some areas of the business. Despite this, net outflows hit 110.5 billion Swiss francs in the fourth quarter, taking the annual asset outflows for 2022 to 123.2 billion Swiss francs, compared to 30.9 billion inflows for 2021. The bank's wealth management division alone saw net asset outflows of 95.7 billion in 2022, concentrated heavily in the fourth quarter. Credit Suisse revealed that around two thirds of the broader net asset outflows in the quarter occurred in October, and ""reduced substantially for the rest of the quarter."" Koerner told CNBC that 60% of the total outflows came in October. Since then, the bank has embarked on an outreach program, speaking to 10,000 global wealth management clients and 50,000 clients in Switzerland. ""That has created tremendous momentum, and I expect that momentum traveling with us throughout 2023 but you can see it if you look into January,"" Koerner told CNBC's Geoff Cutmore. ""The group is net positive on deposits, wealth management globally net positive on deposits, Asia Pac net positive on deposits, Asia Pac positive on net new assets and also Switzerland positive on net new assets, so I think if you look at that situation which we experienced since January, I would say the situation has changed completely,"" Koerner said. He also expressed confidence that the outreach program and ""tremendous"" levels of client loyalty would help the bank retain and build on returning inflows. In its report, the bank said its results were ""significantly affected by the challenging macro and geopolitical environment with market uncertainty and client risk aversion."" ""This environment has had an adverse impact on client activity across all our divisions. While we would expect these market conditions to continue in the coming months, we have taken comprehensive measures to further increase our client engagement, regain deposits as well as AuM and improve cost efficiencies,"" the bank said. Other highlights from Thursday's earnings: Credit Suisse's restructuring plans include the sale of part of the bank's securitized products group (SPG) to U.S. investment houses PIMCO and Apollo Global Management, as well as a downsizing of its struggling investment bank through a spin-off of the capital markets and advisory unit, which will be rebranded as CS First Boston.

"Credit Suisse 'seriously breached' obligations in Greensill case, Swiss regulator says","Credit Suisse ""seriously breached its supervisory obligations"" in the context of its business relationship with financier Lex Greensill and his companies, Swiss regulator FINMA found Tuesday.The Swiss lender's exposure to Greensill Capital led to massive reimbursements to investors after the supply chain finance firm collapsed in early 2021.","Credit Suisse ""seriously breached its supervisory obligations"" in the context of its business relationship with financier Lex Greensill and his companies, Swiss regulator FINMA concluded Tuesday. The embattled Swiss lender's exposure to the London-based Greensill Capital resulted in massive reimbursements to investors after the supply chain finance firm collapsed in early 2021. ""In its proceedings, FINMA concluded that Credit Suisse Group seriously breached its supervisory duty to adequately identify, limit and monitor risks in the context of the business relationship with Lex Greensill over a period of years,"" the regulator said, adding that it also found ""serious deficiencies in the bank's organisational structures"" during the period under investigation. ""Furthermore, it did not sufficiently fulfil its supervisory duties as an asset manager. FINMA thus concludes that there has been a serious breach of Swiss supervisory law."" Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Körner welcomed the conclusion of the FINMA investigation in a statement Tuesday. ""This marks an important step towards the final resolution of the SCFF issue. FINMA's review has reinforced many of the findings of the Board-initiated independent review and underlines the importance of the actions we have taken in recent years to strengthen our Risk and Compliance culture. We also continue to focus on maximizing recovery for fund investors,"" he said. In March 2021, Credit Suisse closed four supply chain finance funds at short notice related to Greensill companies. The funds were distributed to qualified investors with client documentation indicating low risk, and client exposure sat at around $10 billion at the time of the closure. The Greensill saga was a key reason behind Credit Suisse's massive overhaul of its risk management and compliance operations, alongside the collapse of Archegos Capital. Credit Suisse highlighted that, since March 2021, it has undergone senior management changes, implemented disciplinary measures and a new global accountability model, increased governance oversight and strengthened controls by moving risk oversight into a dedicated divisional risk management function. FINMA announced Tuesday that it has ordered remedial measures and opened four enforcement proceedings against former Credit Suisse managers. ""In future, the bank will have to periodically review at executive board level the most important business relationships (around 500) in particular for counterparty risks,"" the regulator said. ""In addition, the bank is required to record the responsibilities of its approximately 600 highest-ranking employees in a responsibility document."" Credit Suisse noted that all of the requirements identified by the regulator ""are being addressed through the organizational measures already underway.""

In the Tuesday annual report, Credit Suisse revealed that it had identified ""certain material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting"" for the years 2021 and 2022. These issues related to a ""failure to design and maintain an effective risk assessment process to identify and analyze the risk of material misstatements"" and various flaws in internal control and communication.

Meanwhile, speaking to CNBC's Hadley Gamble during a panel session in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on Wednesday morning, Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann declined to comment on whether his firm would need any sort of government assistance in the future. When asked if he would rule out some kind of assistance, Lehmann answered, ""That's not the topic."" ""We are regulated, we have strong capital ratios, very strong balance sheet. We are all hands on deck. So that's not the topic whatsoever."" The Swiss National Bank declined to comment on Credit Suisse's share price move, Reuters reported. Investors are also continuing to assess the impact of the bank's Tuesday announcement that it had found ""material weaknesses"" in its financial reporting processes for 2022 and 2021.

Credit Suisse to borrow up to nearly $54 billion from Swiss National Bank,Credit Suisse will be borrowing up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($53.68 billion) from the Swiss National Bank under a covered loan facility and a short-term liquidity facility.The measures come after shares of the lender saw sharp declines on Wednesday after its top investor Saudi National Bank said it would not be able to provide further assistance.,"In this article Credit Suisse announced it will be borrowing up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($53.68 billion) from the Swiss National Bank under a covered loan facility and a short-term liquidity facility. The decision comes shortly after shares of the lender fell sharply Wednesday, hitting an all-time low for a second consecutive day after its top investor Saudi National Bank was quoted as saying it won't be able to provide further assistance. The latest steps will ""support Credit Suisse's core businesses and clients as Credit Suisse takes the necessary steps to create a simpler and more focused bank built around client needs,"" the company said in an announcement. In addition, the bank is making a cash tender offer in relation to ten U.S. dollar denominated senior debt securities for an aggregate consideration of up to $2.5 billion – as well as a separate offer to four Euro denominated senior debt securities for up to an aggregate 500 million euros, the company said. ""These measures demonstrate decisive action to strengthen Credit Suisse as we continue our strategic transformation to deliver value to our clients and other stakeholders,"" Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Koerner said. ""We thank the SNB and FINMA as we execute our strategic transformation,"" he said, referring to the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority. ""My team and I are resolved to move forward rapidly to deliver a simpler and more focused bank built around client needs."" U.S. futures climbed, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures gaining by more than 100 points after the announcement. S&P 500 futures also rose 0.45% and Nasdaq 100 futures climbed 0.54%. Saudi National Bank told CNBC that Credit Suisse has not asked for financial assistance and that Wednesday's panic was unwarranted. ""There has been no discussions with Credit Suisse about providing assistance,"" said Ammar Al Khudairy, chairman of Saudi National Bank, Credit Suisse's largest shareholder. ""I don't know where the word 'assistance' came from, there has been no discussions whatsoever since October,"" he told CNBC's Hadley Gamble. He added that the latest market turmoil in the banking sector is ""isolated"" and stems from ""a little bit of panic."" ""If you look at how the entire banking sector has dropped, unfortunately, a lot of people were just looking for excuses ... it's panic, a little bit of panic,"" he said on CNBC's ""Capital Connection."" In the wake of the Credit Suisse saga, Tabbush Report founder Daniel Tabbush emphasized that a wider concern for the banking sector is trust. ""The obvious problem is a restoration of trust, and to stop the deposit flight, which maybe this has been partly or wholly addressed by the central bank,"" he told CNBC's ""Street Signs Asia."" ""But what is more difficult is not simply containing its issues, is really how this feeds through to so many interconnected banks, where there are Credit Swiss contracts – where there are derivatives, where there are facilities – which is really the next order issue,"" he said. Banks in the Asia-Pacific also pared some earlier losses – Japan's Topix earlier plunged by more than 2% and last traded 1.4% lower. The Commonwealth Bank of Australia pared most of its losses in volatile trading – it traded 0.15% lower after falling as much as 1.97% earlier. Westpac Banking and National Australia Bank fell as much as 2.35% and 1.81% respectively before erasing some declines. They were last down 1.34% and 0.58% lower, respectively. Some South Korean banks also fell as much as 2% earlier before partially reversing declines. The Swiss franc remained volatile following the announcement, strengthening 0.17% to 0.9315 against the U.S. dollar. The Japanese yen also strengthened further to trade at 132.86 against the greenback. Earlier this week, Credit Suisse chairman Axel Lehmann told CNBC's Hadley Gamble that the recent collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is ""local and contained.""

'The weakest links are cracking': Investors consider possible Credit Suisse contagion,"Shares of Credit Suisse surged higher Thursday, rebounding from a fresh all-time low after the beleaguered lender received central bank support to shore up its finances.The abrupt loss of confidence in Credit Suisse, which comes as fears about the health of the banking system spread from the U.S. to Europe, has prompted some to question the ""true"" worth of Credit Suisse's share price.""The weakest links are cracking and that's just happening, and that was entirely predictable — and this will not be the last one,"" Beat Wittmann, chairman of Switzerland's Porta Advisors, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday.","In this article Shares of Credit Suisse surged Thursday, rebounding from a fresh all-time low after the beleaguered lender announced it would tap central bank support to shore up its finances. Switzerland's second-largest bank said it would borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($53.68 billion) from the Swiss National Bank, providing a moment of relief for investors after the Zurich-headquartered firm led Europe's banking sector on a wild ride lower during the previous session. The Swiss-listed stock was trading around 17% higher at 1:35 p.m. London time (9:35 a.m. ET) — a massive swing from Wednesday's more than 30% tumble after its biggest backer said it wouldn't provide further assistance due to regulatory restrictions. The abrupt loss of confidence in Credit Suisse, which came as fears about the health of the banking system spread from the U.S. to Europe, has prompted some to question the ""true"" worth of Credit Suisse's stock price. ""We have to step back and look of course at the viability of the business model [and] at the overall regulatory landscape,"" Beat Wittmann, chairman of Switzerland's Porta Advisors, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday. ""I think the leadership of the bank has to really use now this lifeline to review their plan because obviously, the capital markets have not bought the plan as we have seen by the performances of the equity price and the credit default swaps very recently."" Asked for his views on the sharp fall of Credit Suisse's share price — which dropped below 2 Swiss francs for the first time on Wednesday — Wittmann said a ""brutal"" monetary tightening cycle led by major central banks in recent months meant companies vulnerable to shocks were now beginning to ""really suffer."" ""The weakest links are cracking and that's just happening, and that was entirely predictable — and this will not be the last one. So, now it is really time for policymakers to restore confidence and liquidity in the system, be it in the U.S., be it in Switzerland, or be it somewhere else,"" Wittmann said. Asked for his advice to investors amid the market turmoil, he said, ""The upside momentum in inflation and interest rates is receding very clearly so I think there is a very healthy underpinning in capital markets."" ""But I would very strongly recommend sticking to high-quality companies — that means strong management, strong balance sheets, strong value proposition. And now you can pick them up at more attractive valuations,"" Wittmann added. Even before the shock collapse of two U.S. banks last week, Credit Suisse has been beset with problems in recent years, including money laundering charges and spying allegations. The bank's disclosure earlier this week of ""material weaknesses"" in its reporting added to investor concerns. Credit Suisse management said Wednesday, however, that its latest step to secure a sizable funding deal showed ""decisive action"" to strengthen the business. It thanked the Swiss National Bank and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority for their support. Analysts welcomed the move and suggested fears of a fresh banking crisis may be overstated. ""A stronger liquidity position and a backstop provided by the Swiss National Bank with the support from Finma are positive,"" Anke Reingen, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, said Thursday in a research note. ""Regaining trust is key for the CS shares. Measures taken should provide some comfort that a spillover to the sector could be contained, but the situation remains uncertain,"" she added. Analysts at UBS, meanwhile, said market participants were ""grappling with three interrelated but different issues: bank solvency, bank liquidity, and bank profitability."" ""In short, we think bank solvency fears are overdone, and most banks retain strong liquidity positions,"" they added. For Dan Scott, head of multi-asset management at Swiss asset manager Vontobel — who used to work at Credit Suisse — it's not all bad news. ""I would say that Credit Suisse specifically is still one of the world's largest asset managers, it has half a trillion in assets, and certainly this could be a great turnaround story if the execution is good,"" he told ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Thursday. Asked by CNBC's Geoff Cutmore whether this would mean investors staying patient despite market turbulence and the scale of outflows from the bank, Scott replied: ""Absolutely. But I think again that the stress that we're seeing at the moment really should have been predictable."" ""When rates come up so fast, certain business models get challenged and I don't think it is a wealth management business model that gets challenged. I think much more and why we saw it at Silicon Valley Bank, is private markets are going to be challenged,"" Scott added.",2023-03-16 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/16/credit-suisse-investors-wary-of-contagion-amid-banking-crisis-fears.html?&qsearchterm=,8,1,777,-1.

This week's intervention by Swiss authorities, which also reaffirmed that Credit Suisse met the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on ""systemically important banks,"" prompted shares to jump more than 18% on Thursday after closing at an all-time low on Wednesday. Credit Suisse also offered to buy back around 3 billion francs' worth of debt, relating to 10 U.S. dollar-denominated senior debt securities and four euro-denominated senior debt securities. The slide to Wednesday's low came after top investor the Saudi National Bank revealed it would not provide the bank with any more cash due to regulatory requirements, compounding a downward spiral in Credit Suisse's share price that began with the delay of its annual results over financial reporting concerns. The bank's Swiss-listed shares ended the week down 25.5%. The bank is undergoing a massive strategic overhaul aimed at restoring stability and profitability after a litany of losses and scandals. The restructure involves the spin-off of the investment bank to form U.S.-based CS First Boston, a steep reduction in exposure to risk-weighted assets, and a $4.2 billion capital raise funded in part by the 9.9% stake acquired by the Saudi National Bank. However, capital markets and stakeholders appear unconvinced. The share price has fallen sharply over the last year and Credit Suisse has seen huge outflows in assets under management, losing around 38% of its deposits in the fourth quarter of 2022.

""This support from the SNB and the statement from regulators indicate that Credit Suisse in its current form will continue,"" he said in a note Thursday.

From spying to Swiss bailout: How years of turbulence at Credit Suisse came to a head,"Credit Suisse is currently undergoing a massive strategic overhaul in a bid to address chronic issues.The stock has been in persistent decline since the crisis, against the backdrop of investment banking underperformance and a litany of scandals and risk management failures.On Wednesday evening, Credit Suisse announced that it would exercise its option to borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs from the Swiss National Bank.Wednesday's close at 1.697 Swiss francs per share was down almost 98% from the stock's all-time high in April 2007.","Credit Suisse received a liquidity lifeline from the Swiss National Bank this week after its share price plunged to an all-time low, but the embattled lender's path to the brink has been a long and tumultuous one. The announcement that Credit Suisse would borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the central bank came after consecutive sessions of steep drops in its share price. It made Credit Suisse the first major bank to receive such an intervention since the 2008 Global Financial Crisis. The bank's shares ended Wednesday at 1.697 Swiss francs — down almost 98% from the stock's all-time high in April 2007, while credit default swaps, which insure bondholders against a company defaulting, soared to new record highs this week. It comes after years of investment banking underperformance and a litany of scandals and risk management failures. Credit Suisse is currently undergoing a massive strategic overhaul in a bid to address these chronic issues. Current CEO and Credit Suisse veteran Ulrich Koerner took over from Thomas Gottstein in July, as poor investment bank performance and mounting litigation provisions continued to hammer earnings. Gottstein took the reins in early 2020 following the resignation of predecessor Tidjane Thiam in the wake of a bizarre spying scandal, in which UBS-bound former wealth management boss Iqbal Khan was tailed by private contractors allegedly at the direction of former COO Pierre-Olivier Bouee. The saga also saw the suicide of a private investigator and the resignations of a slew of executives. The former head of Credit Suisse's flagship domestic bank widely perceived as a steady hand, Gottstein sought to lay to rest an era plagued by scandal. That mission was short-lived. In early 2021, he found himself dealing with the fallout from two huge crises. The bank's exposure to the collapses of U.S. family hedge fund Archegos Capital and British supply chain finance firm Greensill Capital saddled it with massive litigation and reimbursement costs. These oversight failures resulted in a massive shakeup of Credit Suisse's investment banking, risk and compliance and asset management divisions. In April 2021, former Lloyds Banking Group CEO Antonio Horta-Osorio was brought in to clean up the bank's culture after the string of scandals, announcing a new strategy in November. But in January 2022, Horta-Osorio was forced to resign after being found to have twice violated Covid-19 quarantine rules. He was replaced by UBS executive Axel Lehmann. In February 2022, the bank faced fresh scrutiny after leaked data purported to show it had served human rights abusers, corrupt politicians and sanctioned businessmen for decades. Legacy compliance skeletons also continued to emerge from the closet. In June 2022, Credit Suisse was found guilty in Switzerland's Federal Criminal Court of failing to prevent an alleged Bulgarian cocaine trafficking gang from laundering profits via the bank between 2004 and 2008. With litigation provisions mounting and performance still trailing its peers, the losses deepened in both the company's earnings and its share price. After a 1.593 billion Swiss franc loss in the second quarter of 2022, and two months after Lehmann staunchly denied talks of a change in leadership, Credit Suisse announced that Gottstein would be replaced with Koerner. The bank began another costly sweeping transformation project as Koerner and Lehmann set out to return the embattled lender to long-term stability and profitability. This included the spin-off of Credit Suisse's investment banking division to form U.S.-based CS First Boston, a significant cut in exposure to risk-weighted assets and a $4.2 billion capital raise, which saw the Saudi National Bank take a 9.9% stake to become the largest shareholder. Credit Suisse reported a full-year net loss of 7.3 billion Swiss francs for 2022, predicting another ""substantial"" loss in 2023 before returning to profitability in 2024. Reports of liquidity concerns late in the year led to huge outflows of assets under management, which hit 110.5 billion Swiss francs in the fourth quarter. After yet another sharp share price fall on the back of its annual results in early February, Credit Suisse shares entered March 2023 trading at a paltry 2.85 Swiss francs per share, but things were about to get worse still. On March 9, the company was forced to delay its 2022 annual report after a late call from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission relating to a ""technical assessment of previously disclosed revisions to the consolidated cash flow statements"" in 2019 and 2020. The report was eventually published the following Tuesday, and Credit Suisse noted that ""material weaknesses"" were found in its financial reporting processes for 2021 and 2022, though it confirmed that its previously announced financial statements were still accurate. Having already suffered the global risk-off jolt resulting from the collapse of U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank, the combination of these remarks and confirmation that outflows had not reversed compounded Credit Suisse's share price losses. And on Wednesday, it went into freefall, as top investor the Saudi National Bank said it was not able to provide any more cash to Credit Suisse due to regulatory restrictions. Despite the SNB clarifying that it still believed in the transformation project, shares dived 24% to an all-time low. On Wednesday evening, Credit Suisse announced that it would exercise its option to borrow up to 50 billion Swiss francs from the Swiss National Bank under a covered loan facility and a short-term liquidity facility. The Swiss National Bank and the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority said in a statement Wednesday that Credit Suisse ""meets the capital and liquidity requirements imposed on systemically important banks."" The support from the central bank and reassurance on Credit Suisse's financial position led to a 20% pop in the share price on Thursday, and may have reassured depositors for now. However, analysts suggest questions will remain as to where the market will place the stock's true value for shareholders in the absence of this buffer from the Swiss authorities.",2023-03-17 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/17/credit-suisse-timeline-how-years-of-turbulence-came-to-a-head.html?&qsearchterm=,18,1,979,"-1.

Credit Suisse's management began crunch talks this weekend to assess ""strategic scenarios"" for the bank, Reuters reported citing sources. It comes after the Financial Times reported Friday that UBS is in talks to take over all or part of Credit Suisse, citing multiple people involved in the discussions. Neither bank commented on the report when contacted by CNBC. According to the FT, the Swiss National Bank and Finma, its regulator, are behind the negotiations, which are aimed at boosting confidence in the Swiss banking sector. The bank's U.S.-listed shares were around 7% higher in after-hours trading early Saturday. Credit Suisse is undergoing a massive strategic overhaul aimed at restoring stability and profitability after a litany of losses and scandals, but markets and stakeholders still appear unconvinced. Shares fell again on Friday to register their worst weekly decline since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, failing to hold on to Thursday's gains which followed an announcement that Credit Suisse would access a loan of up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the central bank. There has long been chatter that parts — or all — of Credit Suisse could be acquired by domestic rival UBS, which boasts a market cap of around $60 billion to its struggling compatriot's $7 billion. Beat Wittmann, chairman and partner at Swiss advisory firm Porta Advisors, said he expects a merger to be announced before market open Monday.    ""If negotiations this weekend won't be successful then expect that CS will be under non stop fire from a falling equity price, soaring credit default swaps prices, bank counterparties cutting lines, client assets' outflows and international regulators in New York, London and Frankfurt,"" he warned.  ""Key elements of a straightforward corporate financial transaction have to be to unwind and/or sell crucial parts of the investment bank and secure continuation of the Swiss bank's business,"" Wittmann added.  JPMorgan's Kian Abouhossein described a takeover ""as the more likely scenario, especially by UBS."" In a note Thursday, he said a sale to UBS would likely lead to: The IPO or spinoff of Credit Suisse's Swiss bank to avoid ""too much concentration risk and market share control in the Swiss domestic market""; the closure of its investment bank; and retention of its wealth management and asset management divisions. Both banks are reportedly opposed to the idea of a forced tie-up. BlackRock, meanwhile, denied an FT report Saturday that it is preparing a takeover bid for Credit Suisse. ""BlackRock is not participating in any plans to acquire all or any part of Credit Suisse, and has no interest in doing so,"" a company spokesperson told CNBC Saturday morning. Vincent Kaufmann, CEO of Ethos, a foundation that represents shareholders holding more than 3% of Credit Suisse stock, told CNBC that its preference was ""still to have a spin-off and independent listing of the Swiss division of CS."" ""A merger would pose a very high systemic risk for Switzerland and also create a dangerous Monopoly for the Swiss citizens,"" he added. Bank of America strategists noted on Thursday, meanwhile, that Swiss authorities may prefer consolidation between Credit Suisse's flagship domestic bank and a smaller regional partner, since any combination with UBS could create ""too large a bank for the country."" The pressure is on for the bank to reach an ""orderly"" solution to the crisis, be that a sale to UBS or another option. Barry Norris, CEO of Argonaut Capital, which has a short position in Credit Suisse, stressed the importance of a smooth outcome. ""I think in Europe, the battleground is Credit Suisse, but if Credit Suisse has to unwind its balance sheet in a disorderly way, those problems are going to spread to other financial institutions in Europe and also beyond the banking sector, particularly I think into commercial property and private equity, which also look to me to be vulnerable to what's going on in financial markets at the moment,"" Norris told ""Squawk Box Europe"" Friday. The importance of an ""orderly resolution"" was echoed by Andrew Kenningham, chief European economist at Capital Economics. ""As a Global Systemically Important Bank (or GSIB) it will have a resolution plan but these plans (or 'living wills') have not been put to the test since they were introduced during the Global Financial Crisis,"" Kenningham said. ""Experience suggests that a quick resolution can be achieved without triggering too much contagion provided that the authorities act decisively and senior debtors are protected."" He added that while regulators are aware of this, as evidenced by the SNB and Swiss regulator FINMA stepping in on Wednesday, the risk of a ""botched resolution"" will worry markets until a long-term solution to the bank's problems becomes clear. Despite a possible UBS acquisition, Norris still expects Credit Suisse's stock to become worthless. ""Our view has been that the end game has always been UBS stepping in and rescuing Credit Suisse with the encouragement of the Swiss government/National Bank,"" Norris told CNBC Pro Saturday. ""If this happens we would expect [Credit Suisse] equity holders to get zero, deposit holders guaranteed and probably but not certain that bond holders will be made whole."" European banking shares have suffered steep declines throughout the latest Credit Suisse saga, highlighting market concerns about the contagion effect given the sheer scale of the 167-year-old institution. The sector was rocked at the beginning of the week by the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, the largest banking failure since Lehman Brothers, along with the shuttering of New York-based Signature Bank. Yet in terms of scale and potential impact on the global economy, these companies pale in comparison to Credit Suisse, whose balance sheet is around twice the size of Lehman Brothers when it collapsed, at around 530 billion Swiss francs as of end-2022. It is also far more globally inter-connected, with multiple international subsidiaries. For Wittmann, the demise of Credit Suisse has been ""entirely self-inflicted by years of mismanagement and an epic destruction of corporate and shareholder value."" ""Broader lessons learnt will have to include minimization of investment banking, higher capital requirements, securing alignment of interest re compensation and importantly that the structurally under-resourced Swiss regulator FINMA would be brought up to fulfill its task,"" he said.  The biggest question economists and traders are wrestling with is whether Credit Suisse's situation poses a systemic risk to the global banking system. Oxford Economics said in a note Friday that it was not incorporating a financial crisis into its baseline scenario, since that would require systemic problematic credit or liquidity issues. At the moment, the forecaster sees the problems at Credit Suisse and SVB as ""a collection of different idiosyncratic issues."" ""The only generalised problem that we can infer at this stage is that banks – who have all been required to hold large amounts of sovereign debt against their flighty deposits – may be sitting on unrealised losses on those high-quality bonds as yields have risen,"" said Lead Economist Adam Slater. ""We know that for most banks, including Credit Suisse, that exposure to higher yields has largely been hedged. Therefore, it is difficult to see a systemic problem unless driven by some other factor of which we are not yet aware."" Despite this, Slater noted that ""fear itself"" can trigger depositor flights, which is why it will be crucial for central banks to provide liquidity. The U.S. Federal Reserve moved quickly to establish a new facility and protect depositors in the wake of the SVB collapse, while the Swiss National Bank has signaled that it will continue to support Credit Suisse, with proactive engagement also coming from the European Central Bank and the Bank of England. ""So, the most likely scenario is that central banks remain vigilant and provide liquidity to help the banking sector through this episode. That would mean a gradual easing of tensions as in the LDI pension episode in the U.K. late last year,"" Slater suggested. Kenningham, however, argued that while Credit Suisse was widely seen as the weak link among Europe's big banks, it is not the only one to struggle with weak profitability in recent years. ""Moreover, this is the third 'one-off' problem in a few months, following the UK's gilt market crisis in September and the US regional bank failures last week, so it would be foolish to assume there will be no other problems coming down the road,"" he concluded. — CNBC's Katrina Bishop, Leonie Kidd and Darla Mercado contributed to this report.",2023-03-18 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/18/credit-suisse-banking-experts-predict-what-could-happen-next.html?&qsearchterm=,25,2,1441,"-1.

UBS has also been suggested as a potential buyer, with the FT reporting Friday that it is in talks to take over all or part of Credit Suisse. UBS hasn't commented on the report. Credit Suisse's future looks to be hanging in the balance after a multibillion-dollar lifeline offered by the Swiss central bank last week failed to calm investors. Credit Suisse's shares registered their worst weekly decline since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic last week, and are down almost 35% over the month to date. The latest slide in stock price came after the Saudi National Bank revealed it would not provide the bank with any more cash, and follows a delay of its annual results over financial reporting concerns. The failure of Silicon Valley Bank — the largest U.S. banking failure since Lehman Brothers — and the shuttering of New York-based Signature Bank compounded nervousness around the global banking sector. Credit Suisse was already in the midst of a massive strategic overhaul aimed at restoring stability and profitability. It has faced various scandals and controversies over recent years, including the fallout from its involvement with the collapsed supply chain finance firm, Greensill Capital, which led to $1.7 billion in losses. The default at hedge fund Archegos Capital not long after led to another $5.5 billion loss for the Swiss investment bank. These — and other controversies — hit investor and customer confidence hard, with the bank losing billions of dollars in deposits as a result. — CNBC's Ganesh Rao and Elliot Smith contributed to this report.",2023-03-18 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/18/blackrock-is-working-on-a-rival-takeover-bid-for-credit-suisse-financial-times-reports.html?&qsearchterm=,6,0,337,"-1.

"UBS offers to buy Credit Suisse for 'substantially' more than $1 billion, sources say",A sale to UBS comes after Credit Suisse shares logged their worst weekly decline since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.This despite an announcement that it would access a loan of up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the Swiss central bank.,"In this article Swiss banking giant UBS on Sunday has entered talks to buy its embattled rival Credit Suisse for ""substantially"" more than 1 billion Swiss francs, sources told CNBC's David Faber. The Financial Times reported that UBS has agreed to buy the bank for more than $2 billion, marking a substantial increase from the initial $1 billion offer the FT reported earlier Sunday. Faber said the price of the deal increased throughout the day's negotiations. The Swiss government is holding a news conference to address the deal at 2:30 p.m. ET. Credit Suisse and UBS declined to comment on the reports when contacted by CNBC. Credit Suisse reportedly balked at UBS' initial offer, arguing it was too low and would hurt shareholders and employees, people with knowledge of the matter told Bloomberg. Swiss authorities have also reportedly been considering full or partial nationalization of the bank as an alternative to the UBS takeover, according to a Sunday Bloomberg report. The UBS deal is being orchestrated quickly, so the Swiss are preparing for the case that it falls through, Bloomberg said, citing people with knowledge of the matter. The country is reportedly considering whether it would take over the bank completely or hold a significant equity stake. The UBS offer comes after Credit Suisse shares logged their worst weekly decline since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic, despite an announcement that it would access a loan of up to 50 billion Swiss francs ($54 billion) from the Swiss central bank. It had already been battling a string of losses and scandals, and last week sentiment was rocked again with the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and the shuttering of Signature Bank in the U.S., sending shares sliding. Credit Suisse's scale and potential impact on the global economy is much greater than the U.S. banks. The Swiss bank's balance sheet is around twice the size of Lehman Brothers when it collapsed, at around 530 billion Swiss francs as of end-2022. It is also far more globally inter-connected, with multiple international subsidiaries — making an orderly management of Credit Suisse's situation even more important. Credit Suisse lost around 38% of its deposits in the fourth quarter of 2022, and revealed in its delayed annual report early last week that outflows have still yet to reverse. It reported a full-year net loss of 7.3 billion Swiss francs for 2022 and expects a further ""substantial"" loss in 2023. The bank had previously announced a massive strategic overhaul in a bid to address these chronic issues, with current CEO and Credit Suisse veteran Ulrich Koerner taking over in July.

Shares of UBS closed 1.2% higher, recovering from losses of over 14% at one point in the session. Credit Suisse, meanwhile, closed more than 55% lower. Europe's banking index rose 1.2% by the end of the session, recouping earlier losses as a sense of calm appeared to return to markets. The volatility comes shortly after UBS agreed to buy Credit Suisse as part of a cut-price deal in an effort to stem the risk of contagion to the global banking system. Swiss authorities and regulators helped to facilitate the deal, announced Sunday, as Credit Suisse teetered on the brink. The size of Credit Suisse was a concern for the banking system, as was its global footprint given its multiple international subsidiaries. The 167-year-old bank's balance sheet is around twice the size of Lehman Brothers' when it collapsed, at about 530 billion Swiss francs at the end of last year. The combined bank will be a massive lender, with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets and ""sustainable value opportunities,"" UBS said in a release late Sunday. The bank's chairman, Colm Kelleher, said the acquisition was ""attractive"" for UBS shareholders but clarified that ""as far as Credit Suisse is concerned, this is an emergency rescue.""

Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics, said a complete takeover of Credit Suisse may have been the best way to end doubts about its viability as a business, but the ""devil will be in the details"" of the UBS buyout agreement. ""One issue is that the reported price of $3,25bn (CHF0.5 per share) equates to ~4% of book value, and about 10% of Credit Suisse's market value at the start of the year,"" he highlighted in a note Monday.

Swiss regulators played a key role in orchestrating the forced takeover, to stem a larger banking crisis that would threaten the global system. The deal was announced before markets opened Monday. Last week, Credit Suisse logged its worst weekly decline since the onset of the coronavirus pandemic.  The developments come shortly after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, which led to U.S. regulators backstopping SVB's uninsured deposits and offering new funding for troubled banks. The slew of headlines around the global banking turmoil have heightened volatility and investor fears of a broader crisis. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority said the city's banking sector is resilient with strong capital and liquidity positions. Credit Suisse's operations in the city comprise a branch supervised by the HKMA and two licensed corporations supervised by the Securities and Futures Commission.  ""All of them will open for business today as usual. Customers can continue to access their deposits with the branch and trading services provided by Credit Suisse for Hong Kong's stock and derivatives markets,"" HKMA said.

Here's HSBC forecast ""The total assets of Credit Suisse, Hong Kong Branch amounted to about HK$100 billion, representing less than 0.5% of the total assets of the Hong Kong banking sector. The exposures of the local banking sector to Credit Suisse are insignificant,"" it added. As of the end of February 2023, Credit Suisse was the ninth-largest listed structured product issuer in Hong Kong, accounting for about 4% of the total market in terms of market value of outstanding units, HKMA said. In a similar move, the Monetary Authority of Singapore said Credit Suisse operations will continue in the city-state with ""no interruptions or restrictions."" Credit Suisse customers will continue to have full access to their accounts and ""contracts with counterparties remain in force. The takeover is not expected to have an impact on the stability of Singapore's banking system,"" MAS said. MAS added that UBS and Credit Suisse do not serve retail customers, as their primary activities in Singapore are in private banking and investment banking. The central bank said it will remain in close contact with Swiss regulators, UBS and Credit Suisse as ""the takeover is executed, to facilitate an orderly transition, including addressing any impact on employment."" As for Japan, the country's banking system is unlikely to be affected by the deal, said Cyrus Daruwala, managing director of IDC Financial Services.   ""I think the exposure to a large wealth manager or an asset manager like Credit Suisse or UBS, in general speaking terms, would be approximately 4% of their portfolio,"" Daruwala, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Asia"" on Monday. That is not ""a significant amount"" he added. ""Japan, I maintain has been relatively shielded, especially from Credit Suisse."" Christopher Kent, assistant governor of the Reserve Bank of Australia, also emphasized domestic banks are robust despite the global panic triggered by banking failures in the U.S. ""Conditions in global bond markets have been strained recently following the failure of Silicon Valley Bank in the United States,"" he said in a speech on Monday. ""Volatility in Australian financial markets has picked up but markets are still functioning and, most importantly, Australian banks are unquestionably strong."" Banks are already well advanced on their bond issuance plans for the year and could defer ""for a while,"" Kent said. ""Even if markets remain strained . . . Australian banks' issuance will continue to benefit from the strength of their balance sheets."" Overall, IDC's Daruwala said banks in the region have ""very, very little"" exposure to Credit Suisse.

'Shotgun wedding': What the UBS rescue of Credit Suisse means for global markets,"Despite bold proclamations from Swiss authorities and central banks about a return to stability, the deal does not appear to have laid to rest concerns about systemic risks to global markets.The cut-price deal is expected to close this year and creates a banking behemoth with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets, but shares of both UBS and Credit Suisse plunged on Monday.While the deal could bring an end to doubts about the viability of Credit Suisse as a business, some analysts still believe the devil will be in the detail.","In this article In equal parts ""shotgun wedding"" and arranged marriage, UBS agreed to buy stricken domestic rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.25 billion) on Sunday. Despite bold proclamations from Swiss authorities and central banks about a return to stability, the deal does not appear to have laid to rest concerns about systemic risks to global markets. After years of heavy losses and costly scandals, Credit Suisse's most recent share price plunge began with the collapse of U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank and was compounded when top investor the Saudi National Bank said it could not provide any more financial assistance. The announcement of a loan of up to 50 billion Swiss francs from the Swiss National Bank failed to soothe investor concerns and eventually necessitated the 167-year-old institution's ""emergency rescue"" by UBS. Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann told a press conference Sunday that the ""latest developments that emanated from the banks in the U.S. hit us at the most unfavorable moment."" ""The accelerating loss of confidence and the escalation over the last few days have made it clear that Credit Suisse can no longer exist in its current form,"" Lehmann said. ""We are happy to have found a solution, which I'm convinced will bring lasting stability and security for clients, staff, financial markets and to Switzerland."" The cut-price deal is expected to close this year and creates a banking behemoth with more than $5 trillion in total invested assets. The deal also includes support from the Swiss government, financial regulator FINMA, and the Swiss National Bank (SNB), which will offer a liquidity line of up to 100 billion Swiss francs, backed by a federal default guarantee. The government will offer a loss guarantee of up to 9 billion Swiss francs, with UBS assuming the first 5 billion of potential losses. Shares of both UBS and Credit Suisse plunged on Monday morning, however. Goldman Sachs said in a note late Sunday that the deal and associated liquidity and loss guarantees provided ""clarity"" and dampened tail risks. The U.S. bank has shifted back to an overweight allocation on European banks as a result. ""Of course, we are mindful that the situation among U.S. regional banks remains fluid. But as we discussed on Friday, we take comfort from the limited contagion from U.S. regional banks to larger money center banks, a trend we expect will persist,"" the Wall Street giant's credit strategists said. Goldman also reiterated its favorable view on U.S. ""money center"" banks, a view echoed by Smead Capital Management's CEO Cole Smead, who said interest rate rises from central banks help lenders ""that don't do stupid things in their assets."" ""Poor stock markets have caused investment banks to be the laggards, but commercial banks look good next to them,"" he said via email, naming JPMorgan and Bank of America as stocks he particularly likes. Smead also said investors could expect higher returns on assets from the new UBS-Credit Suisse entity, along with more consolidation in the European banking sector. But bigger questions remain over the potential market impact of the deal. James Sym, head of equities at London-based investment manager River and Mercantile, told CNBC that the market was in ""seek and destroy mode."" ""This solves what I think is probably an idiosyncratic problem at Credit Suisse, but I'm not sure it's a firebreak big enough to stop the rot for the market,"" he said Monday. Although he added that the rest of the European banking system is ""much more robust"" than it was."" Since the Global Financial Crisis, the continent's banks have built much larger capital buffers in order to withstand systemic risks. Sym suggested that if European bank shares fall significantly as a result of the deal, he might ""start to nibble"" at some stocks, potentially even UBS. ""In the short term, the market is not going to like this deal for UBS, it's not core to the strategy, but I think over the medium term it does potentially give them an edge to compete globally with the Americans and really puts them in an unassailable position domestically."" While the deal could bring an end to doubts about the viability of Credit Suisse as a business, some analysts still believe the devil will be in the detail as the finer points are hashed out over the coming weeks and months. ""One issue is that the reported price of $3.25bn (CHF0.5 per share) equates to ~4% of book value, and about 10% of Credit Suisse's market value at the start of the year,"" said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics. ""This suggests that a substantial part of Credit Suisse's $570bn assets may be either impaired or perceived as being at risk of becoming impaired. This could set in train renewed jitters about the health of banks."" Shearing added that there may yet be risks to the deal ""for legal or financial reasons, or if confidence in UBS is dented and it gets cold feet about the deal."" ""Only time will tell how this shotgun wedding is received,"" he added. As part of the deal, Swiss regulator FINMA announced the wipeout of 16 billion Swiss francs' worth of Credit Suisse's Additional Tier 1 (AT1) bonds, which some investors fear signals further spillover risk for global credit. This was a major focal point for analysts assessing the potential ramifications on Monday morning. ""AT1 bonds were introduced in Europe after the global financial crisis to serve as shock absorbers when banks start to fail,"" explained Charles-Henry Monchau, chief investment officer at Syz Bank. ""They are designed to impose permanent losses on bondholders or be converted into equity if a bank's capital ratios fall below a predetermined level, effectively propping up its balance sheet and allowing it to stay in business. According to the Swiss bail-in regime, AT1 debt is above equity in the loss absorption waterfall."" The entire AT1 tranche of bonds being written down to zero, Monchau suggested, is an ""arresting development"" given that unsecured bondholders usually rank higher than equity holders in the capital structure. He argued that this raises questions about the real value of contingent convertible (CoCo) bonds and creates contagion risks. ""There is also a risk of spillover effect on global credit (although we note that senior secured bonds seem quite resilient including CS senior secured bonds which are jumping in price this morning),"" he added. Goldman highlighted that the write-down constitutes the largest loss ever inflicted on AT1 investors since the post-GFC birth of the asset class, and argued that although it preserves some shareholder value, the decision ""greatly weakens the case to add risk."" ""Whether investors treat this decision as a one-off or whether they rethink the asymmetry of their risk-reward at times of elevated financial distress remains to be seen,"" the bank's credit strategists said. ""But in our view, it has become harder to assess the attractiveness of the current historically large spread pick-up provided by AT1 bonds vs. their HY (high-yield) corporate counterparts, which will likely constrain the appetite towards the AT1 asset class.""",2023-03-20 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/20/what-ubs-rescue-of-credit-suisse-cs-means-for-markets-and-banks.html?&qsearchterm=,11,1,1178,"-1.

The QIA — Qatar's sovereign wealth fund — initially began investing in Credit Suisse around the time of the financial crisis. Now, it owns 6.8% of the bank's shares, according to the filing Friday, second only to the 9.9% stake purchased by the Saudi National Bank last year as part of a $4.2 billion capital raise to fund a massive strategic overhaul. Combined with the 3.15% owned by Saudi-based family firm Olayan Financing Company, around a fifth of the company's stock is now owned by Middle Eastern investors, Eikon data indicates. Credit Suisse will report its fourth-quarter and full-year earnings on Feb. 9, and has already projected a 1.5 billion Swiss franc ($1.6 billion) loss for the fourth quarter as a result of the ongoing restructuring. The shake-up is designed to address persistent underperformance in the investment bank and a series of risk and compliance failures. CEO Ulrich Koerner told CNBC at the World Economic Forum in Davos last week that the bank is making progress on the transformation and has seen a notable reduction in client outflows. The injection of investment from the Middle East comes as major U.S. investors Harris Associates and Artisan Partners sell down their shares in Credit Suisse. Harris remains the third-largest shareholder at 5%, but has cut its stake significantly over the past year, while Artisan has sold its position entirely. Earlier this month, Deutsche Bank resumed its coverage of Credit Suisse with a ""hold"" rating, noting that the strategy update announced in October and subsequent rights issue in December were the start of the group's ""final pivot towards more stable, higher growth, higher return, higher multiple businesses."" ""While strategically largely the right measures have been announced in our view, the execution of the group's transformation requires time to lower costs, regain operational momentum as well as reduce complexity funding costs. Hence, we expect subdued profitability, below its potential, even by 2025,"" said Benjamin Goy, head of European financials research at Deutsche Bank. As such, he said that Credit Suisse's valuation was ""not cheap based on earnings anytime soon."" Central to Credit Suisse's new strategy is the spin-off of its investment bank to form CS First Boston, which will be headed by former Credit Suisse board member Michael Klein. In a note earlier this month, Barclays Co-Head of European Banks Equity Research Amit Goel characterized Credit Suisse's earnings estimates as ""more art than science,"" arguing that details remain limited on the earnings contribution from the businesses being exited.

UBS is paying Credit Suisse shareholders 0.76 francs per shareDespite the loss, Saudi National Bank says its broader strategy remains unchanged. Shares of the lender were up 0.58% on Monday at 9:20 a.m. London time.","In this article Saudi National Bank is nursing major losses in the wake of the forced takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS to for $3.2 billion. Saudi National Bank — Credit Suisse's largest shareholder — confirmed to CNBC on Monday that it had been hit with a loss of around 80% on its investment. The Riyadh-based bank holds a 9.9% stake in Credit Suisse, having invested 1.4 billion Swiss francs ($1.5 billion) in the 167-year-old Swiss lender in November of last year, at 3.82 francs per share. Under the terms of the rescue deal, UBS is paying Credit Suisse shareholders 0.76 francs per share. The significant discount comes as regulators try to shore up the global banking system.The scramble for a rescue follows a tumultuous few weeks which saw the collapse of U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank and shares of First Republic Bank tank as well as major stock price downturns across the banking sector internationally. Shares of UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, traded down 10.5% at 9:28 a.m. London time (5:28 a.m. ET), while Europe's banking sector was around 4% lower. Credit Suisse was down a whopping 62%. Despite the loss, Saudi National Bank says its broader strategy remains unchanged. Shares of the lender were up 0.58% on Monday at 9:30 a.m. London time. ""As at December 2022, SNB's investment in Credit Suisse constituted less than 0.5% of SNB's total Assets, and c. 1.7% of SNB's investments portfolio,"" Saudi National Bank said in a statement. It said there was ""nil impact on profitability"" from a ""regulatory capital perspective."" ""Changes in the valuation of SNB's investment in Credit Suisse have no impact on SNB's growth plans and forward looking 2023 guidance,"" it added. The Qatar Investment Authority, Credit Suisse's second-largest investor, holds a 6.8% stake in the bank and also suffered a steep loss. QIA did not reply to a request for further details. Credit Suisse's demise was a long time coming, with a culmination of years of scandals, multibillion-dollar losses, leadership changes and a strategy that failed to inspire investor confidence. In February, the bank — Switzerland's second largest — reported its biggest annual loss since the 2008 financial crisis after clients withdrew more than 110 billion francs. In December 2022, Credit Suisse raised some $4 billion in funding from investors, including major Gulf banks and sovereign wealth funds like Saudi National Bank, the Qatar Investment Authority and the Saudi Olayan Group. Norway's sovereign wealth fund, Norges Bank Investment Management, is also a major shareholder. The sharp and sudden downturn that began last week and led to the bank's emergency sale is partially the fault of Saudi National Bank itself, some argue. Saudi National Bank Chairman Ammar Al Khudairy on Wednesday was asked by Bloomberg if it would increase its stake in the troubled Swiss lender. His reply was ""absolutely not, for many reasons outside the simplest reason, which is regulatory and statutory."" The comment triggered investor panic and sent Credit Suisse shares down 24% during that session, although the statement wasn't in fact new; the Saudi bank said in October that it had no plans to expand its holdings beyond the current 9.9%. ""Even though the situation at Credit Suisse was not perfect and investors had a lot of question marks about the future of the bank, SNB didn't help calm down investors and shot themselves in the foot"" with the chairman's comments, one UAE-based investment banker, who requested not to be named due to professional restrictions, told CNBC. ""As the largest shareholders in the bank, they had the most to lose if the bank goes under, and this is exactly what happened,"" the banker said. The Saudi National Bank chairman did attempt to calm the situation the following day, telling CNBC's Hadley Gamble in Riyadh that ""if you look at how the entire banking sector has dropped, unfortunately, a lot of people were just looking for excuses."" ""It's panic, a little bit of panic. I believe completely unwarranted, whether it be for Credit Suisse or for the entire market,"" Al Khudairy said. His comments ultimately failed to stem the bank's continued rout. The messy fallout, which spilled over across the entire banking sector, has ruptured market confidence and stoked fears of another global banking crisis. Swiss Finance Minister Karin Keller-Sutter set out to reassure angry taxpayers during a news conference Sunday, stressing that ""this is a commercial solution and not a bailout."" ""SNB's feeling right now is probably like all shareholders in CS — utter anger that management have let the situation get to this point,"" Simon Fentham-Fletcher, chief investment officer at Abu Dhabi-based Freedom Asset Management, told CNBC. ""For years CS lurched from crisis to regulatory fine and changed management as it emerged in a new path. Finally the bank ran out of time,"" he said.

Everyone's talking about Credit Suisse's risky bonds. Here's what they are and why they matter,"As part of the takeover of Credit Suisse by UBS, Swiss regulator FINMA said $17 billion worth of additional tier-one bonds would be wiped out.AT1 bonds are often considered a fairly risky form of junior debt, that often comes with higher yield.They were created following the 2008 financial crisis to shift risk away from taxpayers and bolster banks.","In this article In the aftermath of Credit Suisse's takeover by UBS, many investors lost out. But one group felt particularly left behind: AT1 bond holders, who saw their 16 billion Swiss francs ($17 billion) worth of assets wiped out. AT1 bonds would be written to zero as part of the deal between Credit Suisse and UBS, Swiss regulator FINMA said on Sunday. The move was somewhat unusual, prompting investors to threaten legal action and other financial authorities across Europe to distance themselves from FINMA. But what are AT1 bonds, why do they matter and what happens next? AT1 bonds is short for additional tier-one bonds. In short, they are bank bonds that are considered a relatively risky form of junior debt, therefore coming with a higher yield and are often bought by institutional investors. Sometimes they are also referred to as contingent convertibles or ""CoCos."" The name comes from the ability to convert them into either equity or write them off, so cut their value to zero — but only in specific scenarios. This is often related to the capital ratio of the bank that issued the bonds. If it declines below a certain level, for example, the contingency plan of investors converting their holdings becomes an option. AT1 bonds date back to the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, when regulators tried to shift risk away from taxpayers and increase the capital financial institutions held to protect them against future crises. At the time, regulators in Europe established frameworks that specify capital ratios, so the balance between assets such as equity investments, AT1s and other, more senior debt. This is also the order they are meant to be prioritized in, according to the framework. In Credit Suisse's case, however, the investments of AT1 holders were written off, while common shareholders are set to receive a payout from the deal. In a research note, Goldman Sachs credit strategists said this ""can be interpreted as an effective subordination of AT1 bondholders to shareholders,"" making the move an unusual one. These bonds offered higher yields than many comparable assets, in some cases yielding almost 10%, reflecting the inherent risk investors were taking. The Credit Suisse AT1 prospectus, seen by CNBC, does suggest shareholders may be prioritized over these bondholders — but specifically if the bank fails. But bondholders have questioned whether the bank should be deemed ""failing"" in the traditional sense — a matter that will likely end up in the courts. Carl Weinberg, chief economist and managing director of High Frequency Economics, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" on Tuesday that regulators are meant to protect depositors and the system worked the way it should. ""While I feel bad about all these CoCos and AT1s who are losing their money … this is what the system was designed to do,"" he said. ""This is a perfect example of regulation."" One of the key attributes of AT1 bonds is that they are designed to absorb losses. This happens automatically when the capital ratio falls below the previously agreed threshold and AT1s are converted to equity. Bigger banks often however have a substantial buffer thanks to the capital ratio requirements, so this outcome is rare — Credit Suisse's takeover was the first big test for AT1s. This is also where one of the main risks comes in — if the mechanism is triggered, bondholders can lose their investment entirely or end up with equity holdings in a weakened bank. Another factor that contributes to elevated risk is the power regulators have, who can, for example, limit payments on the annual interest rate of bonds, including with AT1 bonds. Finally, AT1 bonds are callable rather than maturing at a specific point. Usually, banks call and reissue them during a specific time period, but if they don't investors are stuck with them for longer. Various EU regulators have distanced themselves from FINMA's decision to wipe out the value of Credit Suisse's AT1 bond holders. Switzerland is not part of the European Union and so is not subject to the bloc's regulations. But some damage may have already been done and could impact the broader mood of investors. ""European regulators and central bankers are now attempting to restore confidence in the AT1 bond market, which now poses a major threat to any extension of the recovery in investor sentiment in the region,"" ING strategists said in a note published Tuesday. On Monday, Elisabeth Rudman, global head of financial institutions at DBRS Morningstar, told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"" that risks also extended to AT1 bonds at other banks. ""There would be risks attached to the pricing and how investors, perhaps some investors reassess the yield they are looking for,"" she said. In Credit Suisse's case, AT1 bond holders are now considering taking legal action, with preparations underway at law firms.",2023-03-22 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/21/what-are-credit-suisses-at1-bonds-or-cocos-and-why-do-they-matter.html?&qsearchterm=,7,0,803,-1.

'A financial banana republic': UBS-Credit Suisse deal puts Switzerland's reputation on the line,"UBS agreed on Sunday to buy its embattled domestic rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion) as part of a government-backed, cut-price deal.Swiss authorities and regulators helped to negotiate the agreement, which came amid fears of contagion to the global banking system after two smaller U.S. banks collapsed in recent weeks.""Switzerland's standing as a financial centre is shattered,"" Octavio Marenzi, CEO of Opimas, said in a research note. ""The country will now be viewed as a financial banana republic.""","In this article The demise of banking giant Credit Suisse sent shock waves through financial markets and appears to have dealt a blow to Switzerland's reputation for stability, with one executive suggesting investors will now look at the mountainous central European country as ""a financial banana republic."" UBS, Switzerland's largest bank, agreed on Sunday to buy its embattled domestic rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion) as part of a government-backed, cut-price deal. Swiss authorities and regulators helped to negotiate the agreement, which came amid fears of contagion to the global banking system after two smaller U.S. banks collapsed in recent weeks. The rescue deal means Switzerland, a country heavily dependent on finance for its economy, is on track to see its two biggest and best-known banks merge into just one financial giant. ""Switzerland's standing as a financial centre is shattered,"" Octavio Marenzi, CEO of Opimas, said in a research note. ""The country will now be viewed as a financial banana republic."" ""The Credit Suisse debacle will have serious ramifications for other Swiss financial institutions. A country-wide reputation with prudent financial management, sound regulatory oversight, and, frankly, for being somewhat dour and boring regarding investments, has been wiped away,"" Marenzi said. A spokesperson for the Swiss regulator FINMA declined to comment. Shares of Swiss-listed UBS on Tuesday rose 7.3% by around 12:50 p.m. London time (8:50 a.m. ET), extending gains after closing higher in the previous session. Credit Suisse traded up 3.5% during afternoon deals after ending Monday's session down a whopping 55%. Under the terms of the emergency takeover, investors in Credit Suisse's additional tier-one bonds — widely regarded as a relatively risky investment — will see the value of their holdings slashed to zero. It means investments worth roughly 16 billion francs will become worthless. AT1 bonds, also known as contingent convertibles or ""CoCos,"" are a type of debt that is considered part of a bank's regulatory capital. Holders can convert them into equity or write them down in certain situations – for example when a bank's capital ratio falls below a previously agreed threshold. ""The extraordinary government support will trigger a complete write-down of the nominal value of all AT1 debt of Credit Suisse in the amount of around CHF 16 billion, and thus an increase in core capital,"" FINMA said Sunday. The unconventional move is at odds with the typical practice of prioritizing bondholders over shareholders when a bank fails and prompted turmoil in the market for convertible bank bonds on Monday. Vítor Constâncio, who served as the vice president of the European Central Bank from 2010 to 2018, said via Twitter that FINMA's announcement was a ""mistake with consequences and potentially a host of court cases."" The ECB and Britain's Bank of England both sought to distance themselves from FINMA's decision.

The Bank of England echoed this sentiment shortly thereafter. ""Holders of such instruments should expect to be exposed to losses in resolution or insolvency in the order of their positions in this hierarchy,"" the BOE said.

Asked about how investors might now think of Switzerland's reputation for stability, Parker replied, ""When I was in Zurich last week, this subject actually was a hot topic."" He said there had been ""some very modest"" weakness in the Swiss franc against the euro in recent days, noting that this is the currency pair the Swiss National Bank, the country's central bank, focuses on. One euro was last seen trading at 0.9961 Swiss francs, weakening from 0.9810 when compared with March 14. ""We've moved back close to parity on Swiss franc-euro. So, I think to answer your question, yes, to some extent the Swiss franc as a safe haven currency has lost some of its allure. There is no doubt about that,"" Parker said. ""Will that be regained? Probably yes, I would argue this is very much sort of a short-term effect,"" he added. — CNBC's Elliot Smith and Sophie Kiderlin contributed to this report.",2023-03-22 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/21/ubs-credit-suisse-deal-puts-switzerlands-reputation-on-the-line.html?&qsearchterm=,6,0,831,-1.

Swiss regulator defends controversial $17 billion writedown of Credit Suisse bonds,"""The AT1 instruments issued by Credit Suisse contractually provide that they will be completely written down in a 'viability event,' in particular if extraordinary government support is granted,"" FINMA said in a statement Thursday.""As Credit Suisse received extraordinary liquidity assistance loans secured by a federal default guarantee on 19 March 2023, these contractual conditions were met for the AT1 instruments issued by the bank,"" it added.","In this article Swiss regulator FINMA on Thursday defended its decision to instruct Credit Suisse to write down its AT1 bonds — a controversial part of the lender's emergency sale to UBS — saying it was a ""viability event."" The regulator said the loan Credit Suisse received from the Swiss National Bank last week, backed by the federal government, meant the conditions for a writedown had been met. The regulator instructed Credit Suisse to write down 16 billion Swiss francs of AT1 bonds, widely regarded as relatively risky investments, to zero, while equity shareholders will receive payouts at the stock's takeover value. This decision upended the usual European hierarchy of restitution in the event of a bank failure under the post-financial crisis Basel III framework, which ordinarily places AT1 bondholders above stock investors. Bondholders are exploring legal action over the contentious writedown. ""The AT1 instruments issued by Credit Suisse contractually provide that they will be completely written down in a 'viability event,' in particular if extraordinary government support is granted,"" FINMA said in a statement Thursday. ""As Credit Suisse received extraordinary liquidity assistance loans secured by a federal default guarantee on 19 March 2023, these contractual conditions were met for the AT1 instruments issued by the bank."" After its share price plunged to an all-time low last week, Credit Suisse announced that it had secured a loan of up to 50 billion Swiss francs from the Swiss National Bank, and provided substantial liquidity assistance to the lender as authorities scrambled to put together a rescue deal on Sunday. The Swiss federal government enacted an emergency ordinance to guarantee the additional liquidity assistance from the SNB to Credit Suisse, in order to ensure the successful implementation of the UBS takeover. The ordinance also authorized FINMA to ""order the borrower and the financial group to write down Additional Tier 1 capital,"" the regulator said Thursday. ""On Sunday, a solution could be found to protect clients, the financial centre and the markets,"" said FINMA CEO Urban Angehrn. ""In this context, it is important that CS's banking business continues to function smoothly and without interruption. That is now the case."" Swiss National Bank Chairman Thomas Jordan acknowledged in a press conference on Thursday that the UBS absorption of Credit Suisse creates ""a new situation for the advisory authority"" in terms of the new entity's scale and competition considerations. ""UBS will be a very big bank and competition issues will be relevant as well … we have to make sure in the future in Switzerland there will be enough competition for banking services,"" Jordan said.

The latest rate hike comes as domestic inflation remains well above the Swiss National Bank's target of between 0% and 2%. Swiss inflation rose to 3.4% in February year-on-year, exceeding analyst expectations, although consumer prices are just a fraction of the soaring rates of the country's European neighbors. The country's interest rates first moved out of negative territory in September, with the Swiss central bank having surprised markets in June when it hiked rates for the first time since 2007.

However, many analysts were left scratching their heads as to why the bank, which has posted 10 consecutive quarters of profit and boasts strong capital and solvency positions, had become the next target of a market seemingly in ""seek and destroy"" mode. The emergency rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS, in the wake of the collapse of U.S.-based Silicon Valley Bank, has triggered contagion concern among investors, which was deepened by further monetary policy tightening from the U.S. Federal Reserve on Wednesday. Central banks and regulators had hoped that the Credit Suisse rescue deal, brokered by Swiss authorities, would help calm investor jitters about the stability of Europe's banks. But the fall of the 167-year-old Swiss institution, and the upending of creditor hierarchy rules to wipe out 16 billion Swiss francs ($17.4 billion) of Credit Suisse's additional tier-one (AT1) bonds, left the market unconvinced that the deal would be sufficient to contain the stresses in the sector. Deutsche Bank underwent a multibillion-euro restructure in recent years aimed at reducing costs and improving profitability. The lender recorded annual net income of 5 billion euros ($5.4 billion) in 2022, up 159% from the previous year. Its CET1 ratio — a measure of bank solvency — came in at 13.4% at the end of 2022, while its liquidity coverage ratio was 142% and its net stable funding ratio stood at 119%. These figures would not indicate that there is any cause for concern about the bank's solvency or liquidity position. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz told a news conference in Brussels on Friday that Deutsche Bank had ""thoroughly reorganized and modernized its business model and is a very profitable bank,"" adding that there is no basis to speculate about its future. Some of the concerns around Deutsche Bank have centered on its U.S. commercial real estate exposures and substantial derivatives book. However, research firm Autonomous, a subsidiary of AllianceBernstein, on Friday dismissed these concerns as both ""well known"" and ""just not very scary,"" pointing to the bank's ""robust capital and liquidity positions."" ""Our Underperform rating on the stock is simply driven by our view that there are more attractive equity stories elsewhere in the sector (i.e. relative value),"" Autonomous strategists Stuart Graham and Leona Li said in a research note. ""We have no concerns about Deutsche's viability or asset marks. To be crystal clear - Deutsche is NOT the next Credit Suisse."" Unlike the stricken Swiss lender, they highlighted that Deutsche is ""solidly profitable,"" and Autonomous forecasts a return on tangible book value of 7.1% for 2023, rising to 8.5% by 2025. Credit Suisse's collapse boiled down to a combination of three causes, according to JPMorgan. These were a ""string of governance failures that had eroded confidence in management's abilities,"" a challenging market backdrop that hampered the bank's restructuring plan, and the market's ""fresh and intense focus on liquidity risk"" in the wake of the SVB collapse. While the latter proved to be the final trigger, the Wall Street bank argued that the importance of the environment in which Credit Suisse was trying to overhaul its business model could not be understated, as illustrated by a comparison with Deutsche. ""The German bank had its own share of headline pressure and governance fumbles, and in our view had a far lower quality franchise to begin with, which while significantly less levered today, still commands a relatively elevated cost base and has relied on its FICC (fixed income, currencies and commodities) trading franchise for organic capital generation and credit re-rating,"" JPMorgan strategists said in a note Friday. ""By comparison, although Credit Suisse clearly has shared the struggles of running a cost and capital intensive IB [investment bank], for the longest time it still had up its sleeve both a high-quality Asset and Wealth Management franchise, and a profitable Swiss Bank; all of which was well capitalised from both a RWA [risk-weighted asset] and Leverage exposure standpoint."" They added that whatever the quality of the franchise, the events of recent months had proven that such institutions ""rely entirely on trust."" ""Where Deutsche's governance fumbles could not incrementally 'cost' the bank anything in franchise loss, Credit Suisse's were immediately punished with investor outflows in the Wealth Management division, causing what should have been seen as the bank's 'crown jewel' to themselves deepen the bank's P&L losses,"" they noted. At the time of SVB's collapse, Credit Suisse was already in the spotlight over its liquidity position and had suffered massive outflows in the fourth quarter of 2022 that had yet to reverse. JPMorgan was unable to determine whether the unprecedented depositor outflows suffered by the Swiss bank had been amassed by themselves in light of SVB's failure, or had been driven by a fear of those outflows and ""lack of conviction in management's assurances."" ""Indeed, if there is anything depositors might learn from the past few weeks, both in the U.S. and Europe, it is just how far regulators will always go to ensure depositors are protected,"" the note said. ""Be that as it may, the lesson for investors (and indeed issuers) here is clear – ultimately, confidence is key, whether derived from the market backdrop as a whole (again recalling Deutsche Bank's more successful re-rating), or from management's ability to provide more transparency to otherwise opaque liquidity measures."" — CNBC's Michael Bloom contributed to this report.",2023-03-24 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/03/24/deutsche-bank-is-not-the-next-credit-suisse-analysts-say-as-panic-spreads.html?&qsearchterm=,9,0,922,"-1.

Sergio Ermotti returns as UBS CEO to oversee Credit Suisse takeover,"Sergio Ermotti will replace current CEO Ralph Hamers, who is set to remain at UBS to advise the bank during the transition period to ensure a smooth hand-over, UBS said in a statement Wednesday.The move will be effective April 5, UBS said in a statement.Ermotti was group CEO at UBS for nine years, from November 2011 to October 2020, and is currently chairman of insurance company Swiss Re.","In this article UBS named Sergio Ermotti as its new Group CEO on Wednesday, following the recent acquisition of Credit Suisse. The move will be effective April 5, UBS said in a statement. Shares of UBS were up 2% at the open. Ermotti — who was group CEO at UBS for nine years from November 2011 to October 2020 — will replace the current CEO Ralph Hamers. Ermotti is currently the chairman of insurance company Swiss Re. Hamers will remain at UBS to advise the bank during the transition period to ""ensure a successful closure of the transaction and a smooth hand-over,"" the company said. In a deal orchestrated by Swiss regulators, Switzerland's largest bank UBS agreed on March 19 to buy its embattled rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.2 billion). The move came as governments looked to stem a contagion threatening the global banking system. The leadership change comes ""in light of the new challenges and priorities facing UBS after the announcement of the acquisition,"" UBS said Wednesday. The statement pointed to how Ermotti ""successfully repositioned"" the bank following the 2008 global financial crisis, and ""achieved a profound culture change within the bank."" That allowed the Swiss lender to ""regain the trust of clients and other stakeholders, while restoring people's pride in working for UBS,"" the bank said. Hamers told employees of the government-orchestrated takeover that UBS ""did not buy Credit Suisse only to close it,"" Reuters reported. In the announcement, UBS Chairman Colm Kelleher called Hamers an ""outstanding"" CEO who led UBS to ""unprecedented success despite a challenging environment."" While the acquisition of Credit Suisse supports UBS' existing strategy, it imposes new priorities on the group, he said. ""With his unique experience, I am very confident that Sergio will deliver the successful integration that is so essential for both banks' clients, employees and investors, and for Switzerland,"" Kelleher said. The move surprised some market observers, but one analyst said it was just part of the fallout from the merger deal. As with ""all forced mergers or an acquisition of not equal parties, you can always have this friction and I think that's what you see at play here,"" Peter Garnry, head of equity strategy at Saxo Bank, told CNBC on Wednesday. ""It was very clear that the now former CEO at UBS was not really happy about this shotgun wedding and I think that's the fallout you see now."" Notably, in an interview with Swiss newspaper NZZ am Sonntag in September, Ermotti argued that there was no ""compelling"" economic reason for Switzerland to have two big banks. ""Everything we have seen, I think, since the global financial crisis with regulation is leading us down one path, of bigger and bigger and banks, more and more concentration, which leads to fragility but also less competition and I'm not sure it's long term going to be good for the overall financial system,"" Garnry argued. ""It puts the conversation out there: are we moving towards more public interference with money itself?"" He said the discussions in the U.S. after the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank is, ""to what degree should there be guarantees on deposits above the FDIC deposit guarantee limit? If you do that, what is the purpose of having banks, private money etc?"" ""I think there are big questions here about this and where we're heading in the banking system,"" Garnry said. In a press briefing following the announcement, Kelleher stressed that Ermotti's Swiss nationality is a ""nice thing,"" but not a main driver behind the appointment decision. He stressed the ""significant execution risk"" of implementing UBS' takeover of Credit Suisse, noting the new CEO's expertise best equips him as the ""best pilot"" to navigate the challenge.  He signaled the Swiss government were advised of Ermotti's designation.  ""Clearly regulators have a right of saying no. So we have to make sure that there is approval and Sergio is approved for this role,"" he said.  Ermotti expressed interest to remain in the position long term, saying that the tasks ahead align with his vision for UBS. ""There is a sense in me, and I felt, a sense of call of duty aspect. And also, frankly speaking, I always thought that despite all these discussions around the size of the bank, I always felt that the next chapter I wanted to write back then was a chapter of doing a transaction like this one,"" he said.  Hamers noted that he has stepped aside in the interest of the new combined bank, of its stakeholders and of the broader Swiss nation. He said that the bank wants to ""take away uncertainty as soon as we can"" regarding its restructuring and prospective layoff plans. He downplayed the potential risks posed by the combined bank's scale:  ""I always say the big debate nowadays is not too big to fail, it's too small to survive."" Kelleher echoed the view, observing that UBS has a capital-light balance sheet and that the group's strategy is to downsize the non-core units of Credit Suisse as quickly as possible. Critically, he flagged the importance of matching the perspectives of the two banks:  ""There are cultural issues between Credit Suisse and UBS.

Credit Suisse whistleblowers say Swiss bank has been helping wealthy Americans dodge U.S. taxes for years,"The bank notoriously pleaded guilty in 2014 to criminal charges for ""knowingly and willfully"" helping U.S. clients hide offshore assets and income from the IRS.The now-troubled bank appears to have violated that agreement, according to a new report by the Senate Finance Committee that details ongoing and rampant abuse since then.The report, released Wednesday, details the findings of the panel's two-year investigation and takes on more urgency given the banking crisis.","In this article Credit Suisse, the collapsed Swiss bank taken over by UBS Group in a hastily arranged bailout earlier this month, may bring with it a fresh set of regulatory and legal problems for its new owner. For years, the bank has provided a safe haven for wealthy American clients to hide assets from the IRS — even after it was caught and prosecuted for doing the same thing more than a decade ago, according two former Credit Suisse bankers who spoke in exclusive interviews with CNBC and are working with the U.S. government as whistleblowers. The bank notoriously pleaded guilty in 2014 to criminal charges for ""knowingly and willfully"" helping thousands of U.S. clients conceal their offshore assets and income from the IRS. It admitted at the time that it used sham entities, destroyed account records, and hand delivered cash to American clients to avert IRS detection — agreeing to crack down on U.S. tax dodgers going forward as part of its plea deal. Credit Suisse also agreed at the time to a host of reforms, including disclosing its cross-border activities and cooperating with authorities when they request information, among other things. The now troubled bank appears to have violated that agreement, according to a new report by the Senate Finance Committee that details ongoing and rampant abuse since then. The report, released Wednesday, details the findings of the panel's two-year investigation and takes on more urgency given the looming banking crisis. The Swiss National Bank, the country's central bank, injected more than $100 billion of liquidity into Credit Suisse to keep it afloat earlier this month, while the Swiss government agreed to provide UBS with some $9 billion to backstop losses resulting from the takeover. Senate investigators say the new revelations raise questions about just how much American money remains hidden inside the vaults of a bank whose collapse rattled the foundations of the global banking system. The Senate report, which was prepared by the panel's Democratic staff, accuses the bank of violating the terms of its 2014 plea agreement, which could trigger a host of repercussions if the Justice Department presses the case. It is unclear how much potential liability UBS is exposed to as a result of the report, but a lawyer for the whistleblowers argues the bank should pay as much as $1.3 billion. Senate Finance Committee Chairman Ron Wyden, D-Ore., said his committee had received new information just this week from Credit Suisse about additional American undisclosed accounts that the bank held after 2014. ""It is still going on as of just the last couple of days — even more money has been found to have been concealed and there are very substantial issues here,"" Wyden said. ""Clearly, it's time to prosecute and ensure that there are penalties that send a strong message."" ""Credit Suisse employees aided and abetted a major criminal tax evasion scheme,"" a finance committee aide said, asking not to be named because the report had not been released yet. ""To date, no Credit Suisse employees involved in the scheme have faced any consequences from the United States government for their participation."" Senate investigators say they discovered that Credit Suisse enabled as many as 25 American families to hide fortunes totaling more than $700 million in the bank in the years after Credit Suisse's plea agreement. ""They thought they could get away with it, and they largely did,"" the aide said. ""It's not a question of whether Swiss banks continue to do this, it's a question of which Swiss banks still do this."" In a statement to CNBC, a Credit Suisse spokeswoman said it does not tolerate tax evasion. ""In its core, the report describes legacy issues, some from a decade ago, and we have implemented extensive enhancements since then to root out individuals who seek to conceal assets from tax authorities,"" the spokeswoman said, asking not to be identified because she was not authorized to speak on the record. She said the bank's new leadership team has been cooperating with the committee. Credit Suisse has ""supported the work of Senator Wyden, including in respect of suggested policy solutions to help strengthen the financial industry's ability to detect undisclosed US persons."" She said the bank's policy requires it to close undeclared accounts when they're identified and discipline employees who don't follow its policy. The two former Credit Suisse employees, who worked as whistleblowers with the U.S. government and Senate investigators, told CNBC some of the bad behavior continued long after Credit Suisse's 2014 plea agreement. CNBC agreed to mask their identities on camera and to maintain their anonymity because they say they fear retaliation from the bank. They were interviewed in the weeks before Credit Suisse collapsed earlier this month. Although the bank did disclose and close many American accounts after its 2014 plea agreement, some bankers worked with high net worth clients to keep certain Americans at the bank, by changing the nationalities listed on their accounts and ignoring evidence that the account holders were Americans. In other cases, they helped American clients move money to other banks, without reporting those transfers to U.S. authorities, the whistleblowers say. The report and interviews offer a rare look at the inner workings of the secretive Swiss banking, a world rarely penetrated by outsiders. And they show how compliance systems inside Credit Suisse broke down in the years before its collapse this month and rescue by the Swiss government and rival bank UBS. Bankers are under constant pressure, the whistleblowers said, to keep and bring in deposits at the bank. ""You're under tremendous pressure to bring in these net new assets, which ultimately translate into revenue,"" the first whistleblower said in describing a culture where bankers were expected to keep the assets of wealthy clients inside the bank, even if they had to cheat to do it. ""And that's the reason for the fraud. You don't want to lose assets. So, what you do is you try to maintain them in any way, shape, or form."" Senior executives would call out individual bankers at quarterly meetings where they would read out the asset numbers for each banker. If a banker's number declined, the second whistleblower said, ""you'd get exposed in front of your colleagues."" And as a result, he said, ""there may come moments where people simply omit saying things."" ""'Don't Ask, Don't Tell' is maybe a good explanation to what happened,"" he said. ""They would have clients that are Americans, but they would switch their passports around to show and flag as if they are not."" Credit Suisse bankers, for instance, repeatedly flew to Miami to meet with American clients and yet failed to flag them as U.S. citizens, Senate investigators said. Secrecy drives the entire Swiss banking industry, the first whistleblower said – to a point that the sector may not be able to survive without it. ""Swiss banks are much more expensive, and there's a reason for that,"" he said. ""If you could choose anywhere in the world you want to be, why would you pay more? Why would you be in a place which underperforms in terms of your return on assets?"" If a client isn't hiding assets in Switzerland, the first whistleblower said, ""there's no other reason to be there."" Emails obtained by the Senate Finance committee show just how far the bankers went to keep identities secret and to ensure wealthy Americans were able to switch nationalities — at least for the bank's internal record-keeping. In one email, one of Credit Suisse's banker writes to another bank employee, ""please don't write or document these topics."" One American client, an heir to a $200 million fortune deposited at Credit Suisse, emailed to say they renounced their U.S. citizenship. ""I tried to reach you, congratulation!!!!!"" their private banker emailed back. ""This is a big step for you and I know it was not easy."" The heir to the fortune replied, ""Thanks … hopefully this should also make Credit Suisse now more relaxed."" The heir closed the message with a smiley face. ""The committee's investigation uncovered major violations of Credit Suisse's plea agreement, including an ongoing and potentially criminal tax conspiracy involving nearly $100 million dollars and undeclared offshore accounts belonging to a family of dual U.S./Latin American citizens,"" a committee aide told CNBC. The aide said Credit Suisse closed accounts held by that family worth nearly $100 million in 2013 and moved funds to other banks in Switzerland and elsewhere, but did not inform U.S. authorities about the transfer of assets until 2021 – which was months after whistleblowers informed U.S. authorities of the existence of the accounts. In the Senate report the clients are not named, but simply referred to as ""The Family."" While it's legal for Americans to hold funds in foreign bank accounts, they must file forms with the IRS disclosing the assets and pay taxes on any relevant gains. Americans must file a disclosure document called a Report of Foreign Bank and Financial Accounts, which is referred to in the industry as an ""FBAR."" The committee said the family held assets at Credit Suisse dating as far back as 1979, and they found evidence Credit Suisse bankers visited members in the family in Miami as early as 2000, holding meetings at the Mandarin Oriental hotel and enjoying meals at The Capital Grille restaurant in Miami's fashionable Brickell neighborhood overlooking Biscayne Bay. But aides say they didn't find any evidence the family ever filed required paperwork with the U.S. government or paid taxes on their assets. Instead, the assets were held under one family member's dual Latin American passport. As a result, the aide said, ""They're potentially in legal jeopardy, to put it mildly."" Committee aides say the family's assets were overseen by a high-level Credit Suisse executive in its Latin American division, and that official participated in the meetings in Miami. That's notable, aides said, because that same official was the supervisor of several other Credit Suisse bankers who were previously indicted in connection with the 2014 American offshore accounts. Committee aides complained that Credit Suisse declined to provide the names of any of the employees involved or the Swiss banks that received the funds – but said they were able to determine that information through other sources. The Miami case ""is not small potatoes,"" a Senate aide said. If proven, it ""would be one of the largest FBAR violations in United States history."" Former Justice Department prosecutor Jeffrey Neiman, who is representing the whistleblowers, said he believes fraud is still ongoing and the DOJ should claw back hundreds of millions of dollars in fines that the bank agreed to pay in 2014, but ultimately didn't have to pay. The bank agreed to pay $2.6 billion, but a federal judge only imposed a penalty of $1.3 billion at the time. ""I think Credit Suisse is aware of Americans who are still hiding money today. And I think the bank is doing whatever it can to contain whatever this damage is,"" Neiman said. ""At a minimum, the U.S. government needs to collect that $1.3 billion for the American taxpayers. This bank needs to be made an example of,"" he said. ""We hear tough talk out of the Justice Department about holding repeat corporate offenders accountable. Let's see if those words have actual meaning."" The whistleblowers stand to gain financially if there are further payments to the U.S. government. Under the law, whistleblowers stand to collect between 15% and 30% of any money recovered by the U.S. government as a direct result of information they provide. The Senate Finance Committee doesn't think U.S. prosecutors have gone far enough in holding Credit Suisse accountable, the aide said. The report is part of a campaign to up the pressure on the DOJ to crack down on the Swiss bank, and the recent takeover of the bank puts it squarely in the spotlight. ""DOJ must correct its lax oversight of Credit Suisse and hold Credit Suisse accountable for any violations of its plea agreement,"" he said. The aide cited recent indications of a white-collar crackdown. ""DOJ said we will go after anybody at banks who commits tax evasion,"" the aide said. ""Then do it. We're going to drop you twelve names in this report. Go after them."" The Justice Department declined to comment when contacted for this story. It's not clear what liability, if any, UBS assumed for all this as a result of its emergency government-brokered takeover of Credit Suisse on March 19. It is also not clear how much of this potential legal overhang was disclosed to UBS before its acquisition of Credit Suisse, although a source familiar with Credit Suisse's thinking said UBS officials are aware of the situation. Officials at UBS did not respond to a request for comment for this story. A person familiar with Credit Suisse's thinking told CNBC that it is ""disquieting"" for the Senate Finance Committee to release its report even as global regulators are trying to shore up the global banking system by facilitating the sale of Credit Suisse to UBS. ""The financial services sector and its importance to the world economy has become blatantly obvious to everyone,"" the person said. When asked if he could say for certain that there are no undeclared American dollars in the bank today, the person said: ""I don't believe there is anything there that could be described in this way. Now, you can never say never."" He said Credit Suisse has investigated and not found any more illicit accounts. ""I don't believe there is anything there."" — CNBC's Bria Cousins contributed to this article.

'I am truly sorry': Credit Suisse chair pleads with angry shareholders at annual meeting,"Shareholders took to the stage at Credit Suisse's annual general meeting Tuesday to demand answers and accountability over its controversial takeover by UBS.Swiss authorities brokered an emergency rescue of the stricken bank by its larger domestic rival for just 3 billion Swiss francs, over the course of a weekend in late March.Shareholders began arriving at the meeting in droves on Tuesday morning and a police presence was established near the venue.","In this article Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann on Tuesday told shareholders he was ""truly sorry"" for the collapse that led to the bank's controversial takeover by UBS. ""It is a sad day for you and for us too. I can understand the bitterness, the anger and the shock of all those who are disappointed, overwhelmed and affected by the developments,"" Lehmann said at the bank's annual meeting, the first time its leaders have addressed the public since the rescue. ""I apologize that we were no longer able to stem the loss of trust that had accumulated over the years, and for disappointing you."" A police presence was established early Tuesday at the venue, as protesters and shareholders began arriving in droves, hoping for answers and accountability following the demise of the 167-year-old Swiss institution. A number of shareholders took to the stage over the course of the morning to lambast the bank's leadership and demand further explanation of the process and reasoning behind the deal. Swiss authorities brokered an emergency rescue of the stricken bank by its larger domestic rival for just 3 billion Swiss francs, over the course of a weekend in late March. It followed a collapse in Credit Suisse's deposits and share price amid fears of a global banking crisis, but the deal remains mired in legal and logistical challenges. Neither UBS nor Credit Suisse shareholders were allowed a vote on the deal. ""Until the end, we fought hard to find a solution, but ultimately there were only two options: deal or bankruptcy,"" Lehmann, who became chairman in January 2022, told shareholders. ""The merger had to go through."" At 2 p.m. London time, Lehmann was re-elected as chairman until the completion of the merger, winning 55.67% of shareholder votes. The remaining board members were narrowly re-elected, with the exception of five that did not stand again.  In a statement Sunday, the office of the attorney general confirmed that Switzerland's Federal Prosecutor is investigating potential breaches of Swiss federal law by government officials, regulators and top executives at Credit Suisse and UBS. Both banks declined to comment on Monday. Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Koerner took over in 2021, when the bank was reeling from a series of high-profile scandals, risk management failures and heavy losses. In October 2022, Credit Suisse launched a massive strategic overhaul, aimed at fixing its risk and compliance culture and addressing perennial underperformance in the investment bank. Koerner told shareholders on Tuesday that he returned to Credit Suisse in 2021 hoping to ""tackle the problems that existed and build a new Credit Suisse."" ""In short, I wanted to create an organization that our shareholders, our clients and all our employees could be proud of. Unfortunately, we didn't succeed in the end. We ran out of time. This fills me with sorrow,"" he said. ""What has happened over the past few weeks will continue to affect me personally and many others for a long time to come."" Commentators have highlighted the importance of the deal's success for Swiss authorities against a febrile political backdrop. The lack of input from shareholders, bondholders and Swiss taxpayers in UBS' acquisition of its embattled rival has sparked widespread anger. Speaking outside the annual meeting, Vincent Kaufmann, CEO of Ethos Foundation which represents pension funds comprising between 3% and 5% of Credit Suisse shareholders, told CNBC that they had ""lost a lot of money"" and ""need to know what management is doing."" Potential courses of action include ""trying to retrieve some of the viable pay that was granted for former management, who may have failed in their duties to protect shareholders' interests,"" he said. ""We're still looking for possibilities — it's quite difficult with the Swiss company law to prove the damage. Mismanagement of a company is not per se something we can concretely act against former members of the management or current members of the management, but still we need to be sure that they gave the whole truth to investors and to the market, so there is still open question,"" Kaufmann told CNBC's Joumanna Bercetche. Holders of Credit Suisse's AT1 bond instruments, which were subject to a $17 billion wipeout as part of the UBS takeover, last week instructed a global law firm to pursue discussion and possible litigation with Swiss authorities. ""There is still a chance that the various actors will recognize and correct the mistakes made in hastily orchestrating this merger,"" Thomas Werlen, managing partner at Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan, which is representing a ""diverse array"" of affected bondholders in Switzerland, the U.K. and U.S., said in a release Monday. ""While we are certainly prepared to pursue whatever proceedings are necessary, a potential constructive engagement with the relevant stakeholders could prevent years of litigation. That will be an important focus for us over the coming weeks."" Norway's sovereign wealth fund, Norges Bank Investment Management, announced ahead of the AGM that it would vote against the re-election of Lehmann and six other board members, while Kaufmann told CNBC that Ethos Foundation will only reject members who have been sitting for more than two years. UBS announced last week that former CEO Sergio Ermotti would return to the helm of the new bank as it undertakes the huge task of integrating its fallen compatriot into its business. UBS will hold its own AGM on Wednesday, with further clarity expected on plans for the new integrated lender. Swiss regulator FINMA will also hold a press conference on Wednesday.

"Switzerland faced a full-scale bank run if Credit Suisse went bankrupt, Swiss regulator argues","Allowing the bankruptcy of troubled lender Credit Suisse would have crippled Switzerland's economy and financial center and likely resulted in deposit runs at other banks, Swiss regulator FINMA said Wednesday.  FINMA and the Swiss central bank brokered UBS' takeover for embattled Zurich rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), in a deal announced on March 19. The bankruptcy plan, FINMA CEO Urban Angehrn said in a statement, was ""de-prioritised early on due to its high tangible and intangible costs."" ","In this article Allowing the bankruptcy of troubled lender Credit Suisse would have crippled Switzerland's economy and financial center and likely resulted in deposit runs at other banks, Swiss regulator FINMA said Wednesday.   FINMA (the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority) and the Swiss central bank brokered UBS' takeover for embattled Zurich rival Credit Suisse for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.3 billion), in a deal announced on March 19. As part of the transaction, the regulator instructed Credit Suisse to write down 16 billion Swiss francs worth of AT1 bonds — widely regarded as higher risk investments — to zero, while entitling equity shareholders to payouts at the stock's takeover value. The bankruptcy plan, FINMA CEO Urban Angehrn said in a statement, was ""de-prioritised early on due to its high tangible and intangible costs."" It would have erased the holding company Credit Suisse Group, along with the parent bank Credit Suisse AG and its branches, while retaining the Credit Suisse (Schewiz) AG entity because of its ""systemic importance."" ""The parent bank Credit Suisse AG would have gone under – a Swiss bank with total assets of over CHF 350 billion and ongoing business also running into many billions,"" Angehrn warned. ""It is not difficult to imagine the disastrous impact the bankruptcy of a bank and wealth manager as large as Credit Suisse AG would have had on Switzerland's financial centre and private banking industry. Many other Swiss banks would probably have faced a run on deposits, as Credit Suisse itself did in the fourth quarter of 2022."" Angehrn noted that the emergency measure would have rescued Credit Suisse's payments and lending functions to the Swiss economy, but come at a higher overall cost that dis-aligned with the ""principle of proportionality."" ""The damage to the Swiss economy, financial centre and Switzerland's reputation would have been enormous, with unquantifiable effects on tax revenues and jobs."" Among FINMA's other options, the resolution recourse would have downsized Credit Suisse, with the Swiss National Bank supplying liquidity assistance loans backed by a federal default guarantee. The bank's equity and AT1 bonds would still have been written down to zero, with other bondholders being bailed in. FINMA estimates these measures would have altogether freed up 73 billion Swiss francs of capital, but this liquidity buffer would have heavily eroded investor sentiment. The merger plan was ultimately preferred both to stabilize Credit Suisse and to prevent an overspill of the crisis into the international banking sector, FINMA argues. ""The current fragile state of the financial markets due to the shift to monetary tightening in 2022, the uncertain economic outlook, the crisis at certain banks in the US and the whole geopolitical backdrop were also relevant to our decision,"" Angehrn said. ""There was a high probability that the resolution of a global systemically important bank would have led to contagion effects and jeopardised financial stability in Switzerland and globally."" The failure of Credit Suisse on the recent footsteps of U.S. bank collapses have stoked concerns over the strain testing the banking sector as a result of aggressive central bank interest rate hikes to combat inflation. The European Central Bank and U.S. Federal Reserve nevertheless proceeded with further increases in March. Angehrn said the regulator has been in recent dialogue with the U.S., but did not experience international pressure in its supervision of Credit Suisse. FINMA's management of Credit Suisse's unravelling and union with UBS have drawn intense public scrutiny, forcing the regulator to unprecedented levels of public disclosure, said Marlene Amstad, chair of FINMA's board of directors. ""In this case, however, there is a particular supervisory need to set out the most important facts and to set rumours and assumptions straight."" Domestically, Switzerland's Federal Prosecutor has now opened an investigation into the takeover, looking into potential breaches of the country's criminal law by government officials, regulators and executives at the two banks, according to Reuters. Several bondholders are studying legal action over the AT1 writedown. FINMA said its management of the Credit Suisse crisis drew on the ""too big to fail"" standard developed after the financial crisis, with Switzerland emerging as the ""first country to have to deal with the practical application of the second part of the TBTF legislation."" Namely, FINMA tackled a ""gone concern,"" for which TBTF requirements call for systematically important banks to have sufficient capital so that they might be restructured or liquidated in response to grave financial difficulties. ""For the first time, AT1 buffers were used at a global systemically important bank – they are an essential element in the TBTF legislation,"" Amstad noted, adding that a TBTF instrument applying to resolutions or bankruptcies constitutes a drastic last-resort measure created to restrict financial contagion. ""On 19 March, however, we were in a different situation. The authorities would have risked not stopping a looming financial crisis by using the tool of resolution, but rather triggering such a financial crisis."" Peter V. Kunz, chair in economic law and comparative law at the University of Bern, told CNBC on Wednesday that it was likely the Swiss Parliament will assemble a committee to investigate the relevant authorities' handling of the rescue deal. The takeover has reined in Credit Suisse's independent troubles but heightens the risks posed by the bolstered scale of the new UBS-led entity spawned by the merger. The regulator downplayed these dangers in the context of UBS' historical heft. ""As a proportion of Switzerland's GDP, UBS will actually only be half the size it was before 2008, even after the merger with CS,"" Angehrn said, describing UBS as a ""robustly capitalised and well-organised bank"" whose strategic plans are ""well-founded"" and which will face growing regulatory requirements following the completion of the takeover. ""In Switzerland's 'too big to fail' regime, banks' capital requirements grow progressively with a bank's size. In other words a bank that is double the size has to hold more than double the capital. After an appropriate transition period, these higher capital requirements will apply to the new UBS. FINMA will monitor and enforce these capital requirements. "" The FINMA comments come on the same day as a UBS annual general meeting, where investors are turning to the bank — and returning CEO Sergio Ermotti — for guidance on next steps following the takeover.

Credit Suisse logged asset outflows of more than $68 billion during first-quarter collapse,"Swiss authorities brokered the controversial 3 billion Swiss franc deal over the course of a weekend in late March, following a collapse in Credit Suisse's deposits and share price amid fears of a global banking crisis.The acquisition is expected to be consummated by the end of this year, if possible, but the full absorption of Credit Suisse's business into UBS Group is expected to take around three to four years. ","In this article Credit Suisse on Monday revealed that it suffered net asset outflows of 61.2 billion Swiss francs ($68.6 billion) during the first-quarter collapse that culminated in its emergency rescue by domestic rival UBS. The stricken Swiss lender posted a one-off 12.43 billion Swiss franc profit for the first quarter of 2023, due to the controversial write-off of 15 billion Swiss francs of AT1 bonds by the Swiss regulator as part of the deal. The adjusted pre-tax loss for the quarter came in at 1.3 billion Swiss francs. Swiss authorities brokered the controversial 3 billion Swiss franc rescue over the course of a weekend in late March, following a collapse in Credit Suisse's deposits and share price amid fears of a global banking crisis triggered by the fall of U.S. lender Silicon Valley Bank. In Monday's earnings report, which could be the last in its 167-year history, Credit Suisse said it experienced significant net asset outflows, particularly in the second half of March 2023, which have ""moderated but have not yet reversed as of April 24, 2023."" First-quarter net outflows totaled 61.2 billion, 5% of the group's assets under management as of the end of 2022. Deposit outflows represented 57% of the net asset outflows from Credit Suisse's wealth management unit and Swiss bank for the quarter. ""In the second half of March 2023, Credit Suisse experienced significant withdrawals of cash deposits as well as non-renewal of maturing time deposits. Customer deposits declined by CHF 67 bn in 1Q23,"" the bank said. ""These outflows, which were most acute in the days immediately preceding and following the announcement of the merger, stabilized to much lower levels, but had not yet reversed as of April 24, 2023."" The acquisition is expected to be consummated by the end of this year, if possible, but the full absorption of Credit Suisse's business into UBS Group is expected to take around three to four years. UBS on Monday announced that its Group Chief Risk Officer Christian Bluhm will remain in post due to the planned acquisition of Credit Suisse, delaying a planned May 1 handover 1 to Damien Vogel, who will now take up the newly-created role of group risk control head of integration. The deal remains mired in legal and logistical challenges, particularly surrounding the wipeout of $17 billion of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds. Swiss regulator FINMA faces a lawsuit from bondholders over the decision to write the AT1s — widely regarded as relatively risky investments — down to zero, while stock investors will receive payouts as part of the takeover. At its annual general meeting last month, Chairman Axel Lehmann and CEO Ulrich Koerner apologized to shareholders and staff. Both took their posts within the last two years and inherited a bank reeling from a series of high-profile scandals, risk management failures and heavy losses. Credit Suisse posted an annual net loss of 7.3 billion Swiss francs in 2022, including a 1.4 billion loss in the fourth quarter alone, as Lehmann and Koerner attempted a massive strategic overhaul aimed a bolstering its risk and compliance functions and addressing perennial underperformance in the investment bank. Morningstar Equity Analyst Johann Scholtz highlighted that the first-quarter outflows marked an improvement on the final quarter of 2022, when Credit Suisse suffered net outflows of 111 billion Swiss francs. ""Wealth management clients withdrew 9% of their funds, while the outflows from the Swiss bank (1%) and asset management business (3%) were less pronounced. Customer deposits declined by 29% during the quarter,"" Scholtz said in a note on Monday. He added that one of the ""missing pieces of the puzzle"" was the ""extent of the damage to the Credit Suisse franchise"" during the banking turmoil of the first quarter. ""The bulk of client outflows was related to deposits in the wealth management business. UBS will be pleased that the higher-margin assets it invests on behalf of its wealth management clients held up reasonably well,"" he said. ""Outflows from the Swiss bank and asset management business were also relatively contained. Credit Suisse indicated that although outflows have slowed, it has not turned around.""",2023-04-24 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/24/credit-suisse-earnings-q1-2023.html?&qsearchterm=,12,0,684,"-1.

UBS profits hit by legacy legal costs as it nears Credit Suisse merger,The Swiss bank increased its provisions of $665 million following a residential mortgage-backed securities litigation matter.The lender also said that it attracted $28 billion in net new money in its global wealth management unit.UBS shares have jumped more than 10% since the news that it was buying its embattled Swiss competitor last month.,"UBS reported a 52% annual drop in net profit on Tuesday amid a legacy litigation matter, but maintained it is a ""source of stability"" for its clients during periods of high uncertainty. These are the bank's first results since announcing its takeover of rival Credit Suisse. UBS said net profit came in at $1.03 billion for the first quarter, coming in well below analyst expectations of a net profit near $1.75 billion for the period, according to Refinitiv. The hit in net income came from increased provisions of $665 million following a U.S. residential mortgage-backed securities litigation matter. Speaking to CNBC's Geoff Cutmore, UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti — who resumed his post on April 5 — said, ""We are in advanced discussions. Hopefully we can close this 15-year old chapter very soon."" Ermotti also described the latest results as ""very solid."" ""We saw some inflows coming from Credit Suisse, but, most importantly, we continue to see even after the transaction, we saw inflows, so the demonstration that our clients believe we are a source of stability."" he told CNBC. ""We are part of the solution and not part of the problem,"" he added. Here are other highlights of the quarter: The lender also said that it attracted $28 billion in net new money in its global wealth management unit, of which $7 billion were registered in the last 10 days of March — after the announcement of its acquisition of Credit Suisse. UBS shares have jumped more than 10% since the news that it was buying its embattled Swiss competitor last month. At the time, UBS said that the deal, brokered by Swiss regulators, would create a ""leading global wealth manager"" with more than $5 billion in total invested assets.  However, analysts at Barclays said that the market is ""significantly underestimating"" the complexity of integrating Credit Suisse within UBS, Reuters reported. Ermotti told CNBC on Tuesday that the merger should be completed within the second quarter. ""In the next couple of weeks I will redefine our target operating model for the future, (I) also come out with some organizational announcements and clarity,"" he said, adding that the merger with Credit Suisse is not a ""risky"" transaction and will deliver for shareholders.",2023-04-25 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/25/ubs-q1-2023-results-post-deal-to-buy-credit-suisse.html?&qsearchterm=,5,0,371,1.

Swiss central bank promises regulation review after collapse of Credit Suisse,"The central bank played a key role in brokering the rescue of embattled lender Credit Suisse over the course of a chaotic weekend in March.Thomas Jordan, chairman of the governing board at the SNB, said banking regulation and supervision will have to be reviewed in light of recent events.The demise of the country's second-largest bank fomented widespread discontent and severely damaged Switzerland's long-held reputation for financial stability.","The Swiss National Bank on Friday pledged to review banking regulations during its annual general meeting in Bern, following recent turmoil involving Credit Suisse. Set against a backdrop of protest over its action on climate change and its role in the emergency sale of Credit Suisse to Swiss rival UBS, Thomas Jordan, chairman of the governing board at the SNB, said banking regulation and supervision will have to be reviewed in light of recent events. ""This will require in-depth analysis ... quick fixes must be avoided,"" he said, according to a statement. The central bank played a key role in brokering the rescue of Credit Suisse over the course of a chaotic weekend in March, as a flight of deposits and plummeting share price took the 167-year-old institution to the brink of collapse. The deal remains mired in controversy and legal challenges, particularly over the lack of investor input and the unconventional decision to wipe out 15 billion Swiss francs ($16.8 billion) of Credit Suisse AT1 bonds. The demise of the country's second-largest bank fomented widespread discontent and severely damaged Switzerland's long-held reputation for financial stability. It also came against a febrile political backdrop, with federal elections coming up in October. Jordan said Friday that future regulation will have to ""compel banks to hold sufficient assets which they can pledge or transfer at any time without restriction, and which they can thus deliver as collateral to existing liquidity facilities."" He added that this would mean his central bank could would be able to provide the necessary liquidity, in times of stress, without the need for emergency law. The SNB faced questions and grievances from shareholders about the Credit Suisse situation on Friday, but the country's network of climate activists also sought to use the central bank's unwanted spotlight to challenge its investment policies. Activists failed to gain traction with a vote to reprimand the SNB's investment decisions, with just 0.8% of shareholders backing the move, according to Reuters. Unlike many major central banks, the SNB operates publicly-traded company, with just over half of its roughly 25 million Swiss franc ($28.1 million) share capital held by public shareholders — including various Swiss cantons (states) and cantonal banks — while the remaining shares are held by private investors. More than 170 climate activists have now purchased a SNB share, according to the SNB Coalition, a dedicated pressure group spun out of Alliance Climatique Suisse — an umbrella organization representing around 140 Swiss environmental campaign groups. Around 50 of the activist shareholders were attendance on Friday, and activists had planned to make around a dozen speeches on stage at the AGM, climate campaigner Jonas Kampus told CNBC on Wednesday. Protests were also held outside the event with Reuters reporting that the campaigners totaled 100, leading to tight security. The group is calling for the SNB to dispose of its stock holdings of ""companies that cause serious environmental damage and/or violate fundamental human rights,"" pointing to the central bank's own investment guidelines. In particular, campaigners have highlighted SNB holdings in Chevron, Shell, TotalEnergies, ExxonMobil, Repsol, Enbridge and Duke Energy. Members of a Ugandan community objecting to TotalEnergies' East African Crude Oil Pipeline, were also set to attend on Friday, with one planning to speak on stage directly to the SNB directorate. As well as a full exit from fossil fuel investments, activists are demanding that the SNB implement the ""one for one rule,"" — a capital requirement designed to prevent banks and insurers benefiting from activities that are detrimental for the transition to net zero. In this context, the SNB would be required to set aside one Swiss franc of its own funds to cover potential losses for each franc allocated to financing new fossil fuel exploration or extraction. Ahead of the AGM, the central bank declined on legal grounds to schedule three motions tabled by the activists, and said on Wednesday that it would not comment on protest plans, instead directing CNBC to its formal agenda. Yet Kampus suggested that just the process of submitting the motions itself had helped expand public and political awareness of the issues. ""From all sides, there is public pressure and also political pressure that the SNB needs to change things. At this moment, the SNB is really far behind in terms of their actions taken compared to other central banks,"" Kampus told CNBC via telephone, adding that the SNB takes a ""very conservative view"" of its mandate regarding price stability and financial stability, which is ""very narrow."" The shareholders' cause is also backed by a motion in parliament, with support from lawmakers ranging from the Green Party to the Centre [center-right party], which demands an extension of the SNB's mandate to cover climate and environmental risks. ""While other central banks around the world are going well beyond the steps taken by the SNB in ​​this respect — the SNB has repeatedly taken the position that its mandate does not give it sufficient leeway to take climate risks fully into account in its decisions and monetary policy instruments,"" reads the motion, filed on March 16 by Green Party lawmaker Delphine Klopfenstein Broggini. ""The present parliamentary initiative is intended to ensure this leeway and to make it clear that the SNB must take climate risks into account when conducting monetary policy."" The motion argues that climate risks are ""classified worldwide as significant financial risks that can endanger financial and price stability,"" concluding that it is in ""Switzerland's overall interest that the SNB proactively address these issues"" as other central banks are seeking to do. Kampus and his fellow activists hope the national focus on the SNB after the Credit Suisse crisis provides fertile ground to advance concerns about climate risk, which he said poses a risk to the financial system that is ""several times larger"" than the potential fallout from Credit Suisse's collapse. ""We feel that there is also a window of opportunity on the SNB side in that they maybe this time are a bit more humble, because they obviously also have done some things wrong in terms of the Credit Suisse crash,"" Kampus said. He noted that the central bank has always asserted that climate risk was incorporated into its models and that there was ""no need for further exchange with the public of further transparency."" ""Very central to the SNB's work is that the public just needs to trust them. Trust is something that is very important to the central bank, and to demand trust from the public without leading up to it or supporting it with further evidence that we can trust them in the long run is quite scary, especially when we don't know what their climate model is,"" he said. The SNB has long argued that its passive investment strategy, which invests in global indexes, is part of its mandate to remain market neutral, and that it is not for the central bank to engage in climate policy. Activists hope mounting political pressure will eventually force a change in legislation to broaden the SNB's mandate to accommodate climate and human rights as risks to financial and price stability. UBS and Credit Suisse also faced protests from climate activists at their respective AGMs earlier this month over investment in fossil fuel companies.",2023-04-28 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/04/28/swiss-national-bank-to-face-credit-suisse-and-climate-protests-at-fraught-agm.html?&qsearchterm=,9,0,1208,"-1.

The Credit Suisse brand will operate independently for the ""foreseeable future"" as UBS integrates the business in a ""phased approach,"" the bank said in a statement. Swiss authorities brokered the controversial emergency rescue of Credit Suisse by UBS for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.37 billion) over the course of a weekend in March, as a crisis of confidence among depositors and shareholders threatened to topple the 167-year-old institution. UBS confirmed that it will initially manage the two separate companies upon the closure of the deal, with each institution continuing to operate its own subsidiaries and branches while the UBS board of directors and executive board will hold overall responsibility for the consolidated group. Koerner, who took over the ailing Credit Suisse in July 2022 and immediately launched a massive strategic overhaul aimed at reversing the bank's chronic loss-making and risk management failures, will join the board, UBS confirmed. ""With his knowledge of both organizations, he will be responsible for ensuring Credit Suisse's operational continuity and client focus, while supporting the integration process,"" UBS said. UBS veteran Todd Tuckner will become chief financial officer for the group, taking over from Sarah Youngwood, who has decided to step down after the transaction closes. The combined firm will operate with five business divisions, seven functions and four regions in addition to Credit Suisse, with each represented by a board member reporting to UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti. Ermotti said this was a ""pivotal moment for UBS, Credit Suisse and the entire banking industry."" ""Together we will solidify and represent the Swiss model for finance around the world, one that is capital-light, less reliant on taking risk and anchored by stability and high-touch service,"" Ermotti said in a statement.

"UBS expects $17 billion hit from Credit Suisse rescue, flags hasty due diligence","The bank's emergency acquisition of its stricken domestic rival for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.4 billion) was brokered by Swiss authorities over the course of a weekend in March. UBS also expects to offset this by booking a one-off $34.8 billion gain from so-called ""negative goodwill,"" which refers to the acquisition of assets at a much lower cost than their true worth.UBS highlighted that the short time frame under which it was forced to conduct due diligence may have affected its ability to ""fully evaluate Credit Suisse's assets and liabilities"" prior to the takeover.","UBS estimates a financial hit of around $17 billion from its emergency takeover of Credit Suisse, according to a regulatory filing, and said the rushed deal may have affected its due diligence. In a new filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) late Tuesday night, the Swiss banking giant flagged a total negative impact of around $13 billion in fair value adjustments of the new combined entity's assets and liabilities, along with a potential $4 billion hit from litigation and regulatory costs. However, UBS also expects to offset this by booking a one-off $34.8 billion gain from so-called ""negative goodwill,"" which refers to the acquisition of assets at a much lower cost than their true worth. The bank's emergency acquisition of its stricken domestic rival for 3 billion Swiss francs ($3.4 billion) was brokered by Swiss authorities over the course of a weekend in March, with Credit Suisse teetering on the brink of collapse amid massive customer deposit withdrawals and a plummeting share price. In the amended F-4 filing, UBS also highlighted that the short time frame under which it was forced to conduct due diligence may have affected its ability to ""fully evaluate Credit Suisse's assets and liabilities"" prior to the takeover. Swiss governmental authorities approached UBS on March 15 while considering whether to initiate a sale of Credit Suisse in order to ""calm markets and avoid the possibility of contagion in the financial system,"" the filing revealed. The bank had until March 19 to conduct its due diligence and return with a decision. ""If the circumstances of the due diligence affected UBS Group AG's ability to thoroughly consider Credit Suisse's liabilities and weaknesses, it is possible that UBS Group AG will have agreed to a rescue that is considerably more difficult and risky than it had contemplated,"" UBS said in the Risk Factors section of the filing. Though this is highlighted as a potential risk, UBS CEO Sergio Ermotti told CNBC last month that the Credit Suisse deal was not risky and would create long-term benefits. The most controversial aspect of the deal was regulator FINMA's decision to wipe out around $17 billion of Credit Suisse's additional tier-one (AT1) bonds before shareholdings, defying the conventional order of write downs and resulting in legal action from AT1 bondholders. Tuesday's filing showed the UBS Strategy Committee began evaluating Credit Suisse in October 2022 as its rival's financial situation worsened. The long-struggling lender experienced massive net asset outflows toward the end of 2022 on the back of liquidity concerns. The UBS Strategy Committee concluded in February that an acquisition of Credit Suisse was ""not desirable,"" and the bank continued to conduct analysis of the financial and legal implications of such a deal in case the situation deteriorated to the point that Swiss authorities would ask UBS to step in. UBS last week announced that Credit Suisse CEO Ulrich Koerner will join the executive board of the new combined entity once the deal legally closes, which is expected within the next few weeks.

UBS says it has completed the takeover of stricken rival Credit Suisse,"UBS has completed the legal takeover of its former Swiss rival Credit Suisse.The $3.2 billion deal was agreed in March amid worries about Credit Suisse losses would destabilize the banking system.The enlarged UBS will have a balance sheet of $1.6 trillion and a workforce of 120,000.","In this article Swiss bank UBS on Monday said that it formally completed the takeover of its rival Credit Suisse. ""Instead of competing, we'll now unite as we embark on the next chapter of our joint journey,"" UBS Group's newly-returned CEO Sergio Ermotti said in a statement. In an open letter, the bank's chiefs also said they would not compromise UBS's ""strong culture"" or ""conservative risk approach."" Risk management failures over a number of years played a key role in Credit Suisse's eventual downfall. Ermotti told CNBC's ""Squawk Box"" in a Monday interview that he believed the combined bank — which he said was the world's 21th largest — would ""compete better, serve our clients better."" ""We are the only bank with this kind of magnitude and size and scope that is focused on wealth management,"" Ermotti said. ""We need to make sure we don't fall back into any bad habits or do things the wrong way. But in that sense we have a very clear view on how to manage a UBS-led integration,"" he continued, as it seeks to ""restore confidence."" UBS Group will manage UBS and Credit Suisse as separate banks at least for the short term. Questions linger over the future of assets including Credit Suisse's prized retail bank. Following the acquisition, Credit Suisse and its American Depositary Shares will be delisted from the SIX Swiss Exchange and New York Stock Exchange, with shareholders receiving one UBS share for every 22.48 Credit Suisse shares held. The enlarged UBS will have a balance sheet of $1.6 trillion and a workforce of 120,000. Ermotti previously warned the new group ""won't be able to create, short term, job opportunities for everybody. Synergies is part of the story."" The combined company will report its first consolidated results on August 31. UBS said Monday it expected ""Credit Suisse operating losses and significant restructuring charges"" to be offset as it ditches risk-weighted assets, and forecast a common equity tier 1 capital ratio — a measurement of capital against assets — of around 14% for the rest of the year. In an internal memo seen by CNBC, the bank announced that several senior Credit Suisse figures intend to leave the company, including Chief Financial Officer Dixit Joshi, who only took on the role in October, and Asia Pacific regional CEO Edwin Low. Simon Grimwood, currently Credit Suisse's global head of tax and finance change, will take over as Credit Suisse CFO. Grimwood has been managing integration planning since March, the bank said. Former Credit Suisse Co-head of Markets Michael Ebert will become head of the Credit Suisse investment bank and head of Americas at UBS investment bank, while Jake Scrivens will replace Markus Diethelm as general counsel. Credit Suisse Global Head of Operations Isabelle Hennebelle joins the board in her existing role as head of operations. Asked whether he was concerned about an exodus of talent, Ermotti told CNBC: ""We are always sorry to see talented people leaving, in other cases people were anticipating probably the inevitable restructuring that we will need to go through and decided to go."" He added that the bank had managed to attract external talent after the acquisition announcement. Ermotti's own return to the UBS top job was confirmed in March shortly after the takeover announcement to oversee the transition. He previously led the company from November 2011 to October 2020, managing the fallout from the 2008 financial crisis and a $2.3 billion loss stemming from a rogue trader in London. UBS Chair Colm Kelleher said he ""transformed"" the bank through cost cutting and implementing cultural changes. The $3.2 billion takeover was the tumultuous conclusion of a frantic weekend in March, when worries that severe losses at Credit Suisse would destabilize the banking system drew the key involvement of Swiss regulators. Sweetening the deal, the Swiss government has agreed to cover losses of up to 9 billion Swiss francs ($10 billion) after UBS incurs the first 5 billion Swiss francs as part of the transaction, as the bank absorbs a portfolio that does not entirely ""fit its business and risk profile."" The takeover, which follows multiple scandals and years of share price decline at Credit Suisse, controversially wiped out the 16 billion Swiss francs ($17 billion) worth of assets of the bank's AT1 bond holders. Beat Wittmann, co-founder and partner at Porta Advisors, said the speed with which UBS had managed the takeover was positive for the bank. Going forward will be ""certainly a challenge … but UBS, due to the emergency operation and the collective failure of policymakers and of course of Credit Suisse, got over a weekend an extraordinarily advantageous deal,"" Wittmann told CNBC's ""Squawk Box Europe"". ""There's so much margin of safety in terms of price, in terms of credit lines, in terms of risk sharing with the government, that this is a great deal indeed."" Wittmann said that UBS faces several key challenges, the first of which is the physical integration of the two banking juggernauts and merging of their operating models. Citing a Financial Times report published over the weekend — which CNBC has not confirmed — that UBS had set ""red lines"" for Credit Suisse bankers including bans on new clients from high-risk countries and on launching new products without the approval of UBS managers, Wittmann said ""that's exactly what a bank should do in any case."" Addressing the report, Ermotti told CNBC: ""We have developed that 'red line', which I wouldn't really call a 'red line', over the course of years. This is simply what I mentioned before, we are introducing our processes, our operating model, into Credit Suisse. It's not meant to be discriminatory."" As for further challenges, Wittman drew attention to an upcoming parliamentary inquiry into the Credit Suisse takeover and wider banking stability. Swiss elections could also lead to ""populist demands,"" he stressed, as jobs are cut and branches close around Switzerland. A final trial is the broader macro environment, Wittman said, given the current credit crunch and likely financial market volatility resulting from higher interest rates.",2023-06-12 00:00:00+00:00,https://www.cnbc.com/2023/06/12/ubs-says-it-has-completed-the-takeover-of-credit-suisse.html?&qsearchterm=,19,0,1008,"-1.
